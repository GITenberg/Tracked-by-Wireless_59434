<small>THE SECRET SIGNAL</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey Falconer</span> removed the wireless telephone
receivers from his ears, and sat back in his wooden
chair, staring straight before him, utterly puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eighteen-and-a-half minutes past seven!&#8221; he
muttered to himself, glancing up at the big round
clock above the long bench upon which a number of
complicated-looking wireless instruments were set out.</p>

<p>In front of him were half-a-dozen square mahogany
boxes with tops of ebonite and circles of brass studs,
with white circular dials and black knobs and a panel
of ebonite with four big electric globes for wireless
transmission. Across the table ran many red, white,
and green wires from a perfect maze of brass terminal
screws, while in one oblong box there burned brightly
seven little tube-shaped electric glow-lamps, the valves
of the latest instrument which amplified the most feeble
signals coming in from space from every part of the
western world. It was the newest wireless device for
the reception of weak signals and he himself had made
an improvement upon it, a new microphone amplifier
which was at present his own secret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eighteen-and-a-half minutes past seven!&#8221; he
repeated. &#8220;Always at the same moment that strange
signal is repeated three times. And not Morse&mdash;certainly
not in the Morse code. It&#8217;s a most mysterious
note,&#8221; he went on, speaking to himself. &#8220;Others must
surely hear it&mdash;or else my amplifier is so ultra-sensitive
that I alone am able to listen.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>He took from near his elbow a long scribbling-diary,
and glancing through its pages, noted various entries
concerning that mysterious signal which never failed
to come each evening at eighteen-and-a-half minutes
past seven.</p>

<p>That small private experimental laboratory in the
ground floor room of a spacious country house on the
brow of a low hill in Essex was well fitted with all
kinds of apparatus for wireless telephony, telegraphy,
and the newest invention of direction-finding for the
guidance of aircraft in darkness or fog.</p>

<p>The tall, clean-shaven, dark-eyed young man, whose
hair was brushed back, and whose bearing was distinctly
military, had done excellent service in the
wireless department of the Royal Air Force, and had
won his Military Cross. Before the war, at the age
of nineteen, he had been a persevering amateur, keenly
interested in the mysteries of wireless. His knowledge
thus gained, with crystal receivers and &#8220;spark&#8221;
transmitters, stood him in good stead; hence, during
the war, he had held a number of responsible appointments
connected with aircraft wireless.</p>

<p>After demobilisation he had at once taken his degree
in Science, and then joined the research department
of the great Marconi organisation, in which he was
showing excellent promise. Quiet and unassuming,
he possessed for his age unusual technical and mathematical
knowledge, and great things were being predicted
of him by his superiors at Marconi House.
Already he had made certain improvements in the
application of the telephone to wireless, together with
small adjustments and the use of condensers in certain
circuits, technicalities which need not be referred to
here because only the expert could follow their importance.
Suffice it to say that Geoffrey Falconer&#8217;s whole
heart was in his work. Though he did wireless all
day in the great well-lit laboratory at the Chelmsford
works, he nevertheless spent most of his evenings at
his own private wireless station at his father&#8217;s house
at Warley, about a mile from Brentwood, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
about ten miles from Chelmsford and twenty from
London.</p>

<p>Old Professor Falconer&#8217;s house, a Georgian one,
half-covered with ivy and surrounded by several giant
cedars, stood well back from the broad high road which
runs from Brentwood Station through Great Warley
Street to Upminster. Those who pass it will see a
double-fronted house approached by a curved drive
half-hidden from the road by a high yew hedge. The
big gates of wrought iron are as ancient as the house,
which, built in the days of George the First, still retains
its old-world atmosphere of the times when dandified
neighbours in wigs and patches were borne along the
drive in their sedans to visit old Squire Falconer and
his wife.</p>

<p>Outwardly the house is the reverse of artistic,
but within it is a charming old place, with oak floors
and panelled walls, a great well staircase leading from
the wide square hall, while the furniture is even to-day
mostly in keeping with its restful atmosphere.</p>

<p>The Falconers have lived at Westfield Manor ever
since its construction. Its present owner, John
Falconer, had been a famous Professor of Science at
Oxford, until he retired and returned to Warley to
enjoy the evening of his days, while his son Geoffrey,
who had been brought up in an atmosphere of science,
and who followed closely the footsteps of his distinguished
father, now lived with him on being
demobilised.</p>

<p>By the elastic licence granted to him as an experimenter
by the General Post Office Geoffrey had been
allowed to erect high twin aerial wires double the
length of the official regulation of one hundred feet, and
these, suspended from poles placed in the tops of two
of the high Wellingtonias, were brought across the wide
lawn to the rear of the house, and down into the room
in which the young man was seated.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Always the same long drawn-out note at exactly
the same time!&#8221; he went on. &#8220;Eleven-and-a-half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
minutes before &#8216;F.L.&#8217; sends his weather report. What,
I wonder, can it mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>From the Eiffel Tower, whose call-letters in the
radio-telegraphic code are &#8220;F.L.,&#8221; weather reports
from western Europe are each evening sent out
upon so powerful a note that they are read on the
opposite side of the Atlantic. Young Falconer,
therefore, fell to wondering whether those strange
signals he heard nightly, and which were so
unaccountable, were not in some way connected with
the transmission from Paris.</p>

<p>The eleven-and-a-half minutes passed, and just as
the Eiffel Tower began to call in that peculiar cock-crowing
note which all wireless men know so well,
his father entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hulloa, Geoff! I thought you had gone up to
town&mdash;it&#8217;s Mrs. Beverley&#8217;s dance, is it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the young radio-engineer; &#8220;but
I&#8217;ve just been listening. I&#8217;ve tuned in that same
strange signal as last night. It is really most curious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Automatic transmission, perhaps,&#8221; replied the
alert, white-bearded old gentlemen. &#8220;Did you not
say that there were some transmissions at a hundred
words a minute in progress?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Witham and Farnborough. But I have
heard them many times during the past few weeks.
I know the note of Farnborough. Besides, his
wave-length is different. This mysterious signal is
on eleven hundred mètres&mdash;a continuous wave&mdash;above
the ships and the Air Ministry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And nobody else hears it except yourself?&#8221; asked
the lean, deep-eyed old man, who possessed such wide
scientific knowledge, though he admitted that wireless
was a branch with which he was not familiar. Radio-telegraphy
was a new science, fresh discoveries being
made daily by those who, like his son, were engaged
in active research work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so far as I can learn. I&#8217;ve asked our people
at Poldhu, Carnarvon, and Witham, and I&#8217;ve listened
myself at Chelmsford, but nobody hears it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>&#8220;Your improved amplifier&mdash;without a doubt!&#8221;
his father said, bending over the long oblong metal
case in which the seven little lights were burning in
vacuum tubes about three inches long, and set in a
row. Attached to the amplifier was a double note-magnifier,
and an oblong wooden box&mdash;the invention
of Geoffrey Falconer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221;&#8221; said the young man, whose well-cut,
impelling countenance wore a puzzled look. &#8220;But
I can&#8217;t see any reason why I should be able to detect
signals which are lost to others,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I know
I&#8217;ve got excellent rectification, but not more than the
ordinary type of &#8216;fifty-five amplifier.&#8217; It is only the
amplification that is higher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the signals are certainly a mystery,&#8221; agreed
the Professor. &#8220;When I listened to it last night it
seemed like a high winter wind howling through a
crack in a door or window.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To you it might. But, you see, I&#8217;ve developed
the wireless ear, and sounds that you pass, I recognise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, my boy,&#8221; the old gentleman said.
&#8220;You live for wireless, just as I now live to complete
my great book. We must both persevere in our own
spheres. I am only glad that the war is over, and
now that your poor mother is, alas! dead, you have
returned to keep me company in my loneliness,&#8221; and
the old man sighed at the remembrance of his dear,
devoted wife, who had died two years before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the old place could not be handier for me&mdash;close
to Chelmsford. Besides, away here I can continue
my research work each night without disturbance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. But, surely, you recollect accepting
the invitation Mrs. Beverley so kindly sent us? We
really ought to go,&#8221; his father urged. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t too
late&mdash;even now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey smiled within himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right-o! I suppose we ought,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s dress at once. I&#8217;ll take you to the station in
the side-car, and we can get a hasty bit of dinner at
the club before we go along to Upper Brook Street.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>Then he turned down the big aerial switch which
sent the incoming currents to earth and acted as a
protection to his instruments against either lightning
or &#8220;strays.&#8221; And closing the door of the room,
he went to put on evening clothes.</p>

<p>When Professor Falconer and his son entered Mrs.
Beverley&#8217;s fine house in Upper Brook Street it was
nearly half-past nine. As the door opened there came
the strains of an orchestra. Mrs. Beverley was the
widow of a wealthy banker of Buenos Ayres, after whose
death she had brought her daughter Sylvia to London
where she had quickly become popular as a hostess,
attracting about her all sorts of men and women who
had &#8220;done something.&#8221;</p>

<p>When one was invited to Mrs. Beverley&#8217;s parties
one was certain of meeting interesting people&mdash;lions of
the moment&mdash;whose faces peered out at one from all
the picture papers&mdash;people in every walk of life, but
all distinguished, if even by their vices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hulloa, Geoffrey!&#8221; exclaimed a slim, dark-haired
young girl in a flame-coloured dance-frock and a
charming hair ornament of gilt leaves. The dress
was sleeveless and cut daringly low in the corsage and
the back. &#8220;I thought you&#8217;d forgotten us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Sylvia, I&#8217;ll confess,&#8221; said Geoffrey in a low
voice, taking the hand she held out to him. &#8220;As a
matter of fact, I really had! The pater only reminded
me of it just in time for us to rush to the station.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Immersed as usual in your mysterious old
wireless,&#8221; laughed the pretty daughter of the South
American widow. &#8220;I heard somebody say at a lunch
at the Ritz the other day that all electrical people
inevitably take to drink or to wireless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad I haven&#8217;t yet taken to the former,&#8221;
laughed the young man, and together they went into
the fine drawing-room, where a gay dance was in progress.</p>

<p>A few moments later the young man found his
hostess, a stout, well-dressed woman, who possessed all
the impelling manners of the well-bred South American,
and who had hustled into Society until the newspapers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
were constantly chronicling her doings, describing her
jewels, and printing her photograph, so that Suburbia
knew more of Mrs. Beverley than even Mrs. Beverley
knew herself. She loved Argentina, she confessed,
but she loved London far better. Before her
marriage she had known quite a lot of people in
London society, for she had come over each year, and
now, in her widowhood, she had returned, and certainly
she was one of London&#8217;s prominent figures, for she
entertained Cabinet Ministers, politicians, authors,
painters&mdash;in fact, anybody who was anybody in
London life.</p>

<p>Geoffrey had first met her and her daughter while
on the voyage from New York eighteen months before.
He had been over on business to the transatlantic
Wireless Station at Belmar&mdash;which, by the way, is in
direct communication with Carnarvon by day and
night&mdash;and on board they had been introduced, with
the result that the widow had invited him to call upon
her &#8220;when she settled down.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pretty go-ahead Sylvia had attracted him, and
when one day he had received a card at the Automobile
Club he lost no time in resuming the very pleasant
acquaintanceship. Indeed, Mrs. Beverley and Sylvia
had motored down to Warley one day a month afterwards,
and looked in at Geoffrey&#8217;s experimental laboratory,
bewildered at its maze of instruments, its many
little glow-lamps and tangles of wire.</p>

<p>Mother and daughter had listened upon the relay
and &#8220;loud-speaker&#8221; of the wireless telephone to the
Air Ministry at Croydon, Pulham, and Lympe, and
to the Morse signals from Newfoundland, Cairo,
Madrid, and other cities, until the girl, with whom he
was secretly in love, had declared herself quite fascinated
by the most modern of sciences.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was this fascination which had first held
the two young people in a common bond. On board
the liner, though as an engineer of the Marconi Company
he was constantly in and out of the wireless cabin
because the operator was having some trouble with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
his spark transmission, it had never occurred to him
to invite the girl in to listen. It was, indeed, not until
a few hours before they reached Southampton that
he had explained his profession to her.</p>

<p>The pair had, on the voyage, fallen very much in
love with each other, and now, thoroughly understanding
each other, they were carefully preserving
their secret from Mrs. Beverley, whose great ambition,
like that of many South American mothers, was to
marry her daughter into the British Peerage.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the real object of her lavish
entertaining at Upper Brook Street was to find a
suitable husband for Sylvia, a peer of wealth, no matter
his age or past record.</p>

<p>In Geoffrey Falconer, Sylvia had found a clever,
good-looking, unassuming man, whose ideals coincided
with her own, even though she naturally viewed England
and English ways through South American spectacles.
Yet for three years she had been at school at Versailles,
and mixing with English girls as she had done, she had
lost much of her American intonation of speech.</p>

<p>The pair were genuinely attached to each other.
The only third person who knew of this was the old
Professor himself. Though thin and white-haired he was
a genial old fellow, who dearly loved a joke, and who,
when at Oxford, had been regarded by all the undergraduates
as a real good sort. Many of his students
had made their name in the world of politics and law,
while one was now Governor of one of Britain&#8217;s most
important colonies.</p>

<p>Like father, like son. Geoffrey, though he had for
four years been associated with those young men of
the Air Force who, though so many of them had never
flown a yard, considered themselves vastly superior
to all others who trod the earth, had never imitated
the &#8220;wrist-watch swank,&#8221; nor the drawl of that grey-uniformed
genus who, during the war, brought personal
egotism to such a fine art. He was quiet, unassuming,
studious, yet a firm-hearted, bold, and fearless
Englishman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>Sylvia, thanks to her mother&#8217;s sly machinations,
met numbers of eligible young men, many of whom
had great fortunes looming in the future. But in
the whirl of London society, with its dressing, dancing
and dressmakers&#8217; lure, she passed them all by, her
only thought being of the young man whom she had
met on board the liner.</p>

<p>That night they had danced together several times,
when suddenly, as they crossed the ballroom, the
girl exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! Why there&#8217;s Mr. Glover! You surely
recollect him? He came over with us. I thought he
was in Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>Falconer glanced across to a big, broad-shouldered,
round-faced man, who was clean-shaven, with a
lock of fair hair falling across his forehead, a man with
protruding chin, thick lips, a pair of shrewd blue eyes,
who wore an emerald in his shirt-front.</p>

<p>In an instant a crowd of memories flashed across
her companion&#8217;s mind. For a second he hesitated.
Then he advanced, and greeted his fellow-traveller
across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was awfully kind of your mother to ask me,
Miss Beverley,&#8221; said the big, burly fellow to Sylvia
as they shook hands. &#8220;I took a house near Maidenhead,
but I&#8217;ve been in Paris ever since we got over. I only
got to the Ritz three days ago, and received her card
through Morgan&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re awfully pleased to see you,&#8221; Sylvia
declared. &#8220;We&#8217;ve at last settled in London, and it&#8217;s
real good to be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; drawled Mr. George Glover. &#8220;I usually
come over to Europe twice a year on business, and I
always look forward to it. Americans who haven&#8217;t
travelled never realise the delights of dear old London,
do they?&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently the trio went in to supper together. Quite
casually Sylvia mentioned Geoffrey&#8217;s connection with
wireless, whereupon Glover began to discuss some of
the newest theories in a manner unusually intelligent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
for the uninitiated. This caused Geoffrey&#8217;s thoughts
to wander far from that gay crowd by which he was
surrounded.</p>

<p>The man seated opposite him was something of a
mystery. On the trip over to Europe, at one o&#8217;clock
one morning, he had despatched from the ship a curious
wireless message. Geoffrey had happened to be in the
cabin with the chief wireless operator when the message
had been brought in. He was assisting the operator
to adjust his spark, which was slightly out of order.
Ships&#8217; wireless sets, like watches, are sometimes liable
to vagaries. Why, nobody can tell.</p>

<p>The message sent in was marked &#8220;very urgent,&#8221;
but the &#8220;spark&#8221; was poor, and the range at the moment
rather inefficient. As it lay beside the transmitting
key, Geoffrey read it.</p>

<p>He remembered it quite distinctly because, by some
strange intuition, he felt that it was not what it pretended
to be. One sometimes experiences strange
suspicions. And in this case Geoffrey wondered. He
knew the sender, and perhaps because of his friendship
with Sylvia and her mother, he had felt a little irritation,
for he instinctively mistrusted the man.</p>

<p>The message was of a commercial character, and
read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<i>Betser, King&#8217;s Arms Hotel, Norwich.&mdash;Don&#8217;t
deal directly demand delay execute slowly.&mdash;Glover.</i>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Next day he had found himself reflecting upon that
message, and returning to the wireless cabin, he copied
it. For a whole day he puzzled over it, when at last&mdash;used
as he was to all sorts of ciphers and codes&mdash;he
discovered in it a four-figure code. The initial letter
of the first five words was &#8220;D&#8221;&mdash;the fourth letter of
the alphabet. Then &#8220;E&#8221;&mdash;the fifth letter&mdash;and &#8220;S&#8221;&mdash;the
nineteenth. Hence the message was no doubt
in figure-code, and read &#8220;4519.&#8221;</p>

<p>From that moment onward he had viewed the man
Glover with considerable suspicion, but on landing
at Southampton he had lost sight of him. And now he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
was much surprised to find him as guest of the rich
widow.</p>

<p>Sight of the thick-set, clean-shaven man had brought
that strange message back to his memory, and the
more so because on deck late one night he had seen
the man talking in confidence to a stout, flashily-dressed
woman, yet next day they had passed each
other on deck as strangers!</p>

<p>As the trio sat at supper, Glover was most genial
and full of merriment. That Sylvia liked him was
plain, yet whether it was intuition or jealousy, Geoffrey,
as later on he sat with his father in the last train from
Liverpool Street, pondered again and again.</p>

<p>On his return from Chelmsford each evening during
the week that followed, Falconer sat down at a quarter
past seven at his own wireless set, when, without fail,
there came that strange, inexplicable and unreadable
signal always at eighteen-and-a-half minutes past
seven.</p>

<p>Of operators at the great Marconi stations at Towyn,
in Wales, and Clifden, in Ireland, as well as of several
operators whom he knew at the busy coast stations
at the North Foreland, Niton, and Cleethorpes, he made
inquiry as to whether they had heard the same signal.
Strangely enough, all the replies were in the negative.</p>

<p>Indeed, one night he himself listened on the great
aerial which is such a prominent feature in the landscape
at Chelmsford, but failed to catch a single sound.</p>

<p>Therefore, he proved beyond doubt that his own set
was supersensitive, and that his improvement of the
multi-valve amplifying detector was a considerable
achievement.</p>

<p>He, however, said nothing. At present it was his
own secret. But he was not so much concerned with
the new invention as in the solution of the mystery.
By his research work in the wide field of radio-telegraphy
he had developed a keen interest in anything that was
mysterious, and here was presented an extremely curious
problem. That oblong metal box with its seven little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
glowing glass tubes was the only instrument which
picked up that inexplicable signal.</p>

<p>A fortnight passed. Each anxious day young
Falconer worked hard in the splendidly-equipped
experimental laboratory in that hive of wireless industry
at Chelmsford, where radio apparatus of all kinds was
being constructed for every civilised nation&mdash;that
triumph of the Italian inventor who gave to the world
a means of instant and reliable communication unknown
before those epoch-making experiments on Monte Nero,
outside the sun-blanched town of Leghorn. Truly the
science of radio-telegraphy has made rapid strides since
the days of the &#8220;coherer,&#8221; until now, after the war, it
is the most advanced in our human civilisation, and at
the same time full of romance. Not a month passes but
something new is discovered in that high-built, well-knit
laboratory, where daily the keenest brains of wireless
experimenters are at work devising, testing, and too
often scrapping new instruments, new circuits, and new
devices in order to improve and render less complicated
both the ordinary wireless by Morse, and that modern
marvel, the wireless telephone.</p>

<p>The world has yet to learn what it owes to wireless.
Little does it dream of its aid to commerce in every
quarter of the globe; how much of the news it reads
at its breakfast-table had been flashed through the ether
for thousands of miles, or how every hour it outstrips
the choked-up and behind-the-times submarine cable
system.</p>

<p>Geoffrey Falconer was very sorely puzzled.</p>

<p>But why was that mysterious signal unheard by
others? Further, by what method was it being transmitted?
Being acquainted with every method of
transmission, he guessed, after a number of tests, that
it must be automatic. One day he took his improved
microphone amplifier to the works at Chelmsford, and
attaching it to the very complicated apparatus designed
for the reception of signals automatically transmitted&mdash;a
piece of apparatus far too technical to here describe&mdash;he
sat at a quarter past seven awaiting the usual signal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>With him were two of the research staff, both as
deeply interested in the mystery as himself, though
upon their high-up aerial wires they had been unable to
detect the signals in question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hulloa!&#8221; cried Boyd, a fair, clean-shaven man of
thirty-five, who was a well-known radio-engineer.
&#8220;There she goes!&#8221;</p>

<p>The receiving apparatus gave a short quick buzz,
thrice repeated, and then there was silence again.</p>

<p>Eagerly Falconer took the record which had been
made, and placing it in another small box, adjusted
the head-&#8217;phones, and depressing a key, allowed it to
revolve slowly. The message became distinctly
readable!</p>

<p>They were figures&mdash;<i>the numerals</i> 4519, thrice repeated.
It was that same code-message which the genial Glover
had sent from the liner in mid-Atlantic! What could
it mean?</p>

<p>Two facts were now proved&mdash;that the amplifier,
as improved by Geoffrey, was a supersensitive instrument,
which would, no doubt, have a great future
before it, and bring its inventor both money and fame
in the world of radio-telegraphy. Secondly, that some
curious mystery lay behind the appearance of Mr.
George Glover in London society.</p>

<p>That night on arrival home, he told the Professor
of his discovery, and both father and son agreed that
it was necessary to make some searching investigations
regarding Mrs. Beverley&#8217;s friend.</p>

<p>With that object Geoffrey went up to London on
the following day, and calling upon Sylvia fortunately
found her alone.</p>

<p>With difficulty he approached the subject of Glover,
because he knew that the girl suspected him of jealousy.
She had, indeed, hinted at it on the night of the dance.
However, in the course of conversation, he casually
referred to the man who had despatched that curious
telegram from the liner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; the girl answered. &#8220;We see quite a
lot of Mr. Glover now. Mother likes him immensely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
He is enormously rich&mdash;has great oil interests in
Roumania and in Baku. He made a great deal of
money during the war, and he knows quite a number
of good people in London. He&#8217;s going down to Lady
Nassington&#8217;s, in Sussex, next week&mdash;and we are going
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be fellow-guests then?&#8221; Falconer
remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Geoffrey. But you speak as though you
resent it,&#8221; laughed the pretty girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; he hastened to assure her. &#8220;Only&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only&mdash;what?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;nothing,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;At least, nothing
at present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re awfully mysterious, Geoffrey. What do
you really mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;What should I mean?
I hardly know your friend, Mr. Glover. Your mother,
no doubt, knows him well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;and all about him,&#8221; the girl replied. &#8220;He&#8217;s
awfully kind to us. He took us to Brighton in his
big car last Sunday week, and gave us a topping time
there. He claims to be a American but I don&#8217;t know
if he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey reflected. That strange series of secret
signals held him mystified. So he determined to wait
and watch.</p>

<p>Next day, when in the experimental laboratory at
Chelmsford, he took his friend, Frank Boyd, into his
confidence regarding the signal they had tuned in, and
also told him of the message sent by Glover late one
night from mid-Atlantic.</p>

<p>Boyd, who stood with the head-&#8217;phones in his hand,
for he had been making a test upon a new direction-finding
device, listened with great interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree, Falconer, there&#8217;s something wrong somewhere,&#8221;
he remarked. &#8220;But who can have a transmitting-set
which sends out messages upon a wave-length
that we can&#8217;t get?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be by the new beam method,&#8221; Falconer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
suggested, &#8220;the method with which we are just now
experimenting. Once or twice I&#8217;ve thought it might
be a military continuous-wave set.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If so&mdash;then they are in front of us. That, however,
I very much doubt,&#8221; declared Boyd. &#8220;The Germans
thought themselves top-dogs in wireless before the war,
but we beat them every time on their own ground&mdash;didn&#8217;t
we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We certainly did. Here, in these works, the inventions
were made and developed for the Army, Navy,
and Air Force. It&#8217;s up to us&mdash;to you and me personally&mdash;to
solve this mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Falconer&mdash;and we&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; said the other.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the idea of signals being sent out that we
can&#8217;t read from our big aerial here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are signals from nowhere, yet always the
same, and at exactly the same time. G.M.T. never
alters&mdash;neither does the signal,&#8221; Falconer said.</p>

<p>So the pair agreed to listen still further, and to make
investigation regarding the wealthy man from America,
who had so suddenly arisen in the social firmament
of post-war London.</p>

<p>Geoffrey had some few days&#8217; leave due to him, so
he took it, and, unknown to Mrs. Beverley and her
daughter, watched the gay house-party assemble at
Nassington Hall, the seat of the Earl of Nassington,
not far from Crowborough, in Sussex.</p>

<p>Now, near Crowborough there was a wireless station,
and on the night of Geoffrey&#8217;s arrival at the Beacon
Hotel, he called upon the non-commissioned officer
in charge, introduced himself, and was afforded an
opportunity of looking over the apparatus. Naturally
the man in charge was gratified that such an expert
as Geoffrey Falconer should examine their set, and
pronounce both transmission and reception unusually
good. Then, soon after ten o&#8217;clock, Geoffrey returned
to the Beacon.</p>

<p>That night he sent a note in secret to Sylvia, and
in the autumn afternoon next day they met at the
junction of the two roads at Marden&#8217;s Hill.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;m down here to have a look at a wireless set
close by,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it fortunate? I&#8217;ll
be here for a couple of days, I expect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You gave me a real surprise,&#8221; the girl said. &#8220;When
Thring brought me your note with my morning tea
I could hardly believe that you were so close at hand.
Why not come in to tea? Mother will introduce you
to Lady Nassington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I have, unfortunately, a lot of
work to do at the wireless station. Please excuse me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! I know. You don&#8217;t want to meet Mr. Glover,&#8221;
laughed the girl. &#8220;Now confess it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that, I assure you, Sylvia. But I would
rather have a walk and a chat with you than gossip
with all those people with whom I have so very little
in common.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Geoffrey, I know. You are engrossed in
your wireless inventions,&#8221; she replied, gazing affectionately
into his eyes. &#8220;And, after all, you are
right. We women enjoy ourselves, but men who serve
the world as you do are nobler if they keep away from
all our feminine frivolities.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose Glover is merry, as usual&mdash;quite a good
fellow, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He&#8217;s the soul of the house-party. They
are all out shooting to-day. Madame Valdavia, the
wife of the Spanish millionaire banker, arrived last
night. She&#8217;s quite young and charming. I wish you
could meet her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can if you will only call on mother to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m really too busy, Sylvia&mdash;so do please
excuse me,&#8221; he pleaded, as they walked along the
leaf-strewn path through the wood from Friar&#8217;s Gate,
where half a mile away towards Lone Oak the shooting
party were giving evidence of good sport.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a fancy dress dinner to-night. Every one
is wearing quaint costumes, and there&#8217;s certain to be
a lot of fun. The party is really most enjoyable. I
do wish you would call, Geoffrey&mdash;do,&#8221; she urged.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the young man very seriously. &#8220;I have
reasons which I will tell you afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are always so mysterious,&#8221; she declared with
a pretty pout. &#8220;I believe it is your horrible old wireless
which makes you so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not horrible,&#8221; he protested with a laugh.
&#8220;Interesting, I admit&mdash;in more senses than one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;interesting, then,&#8221; she agreed with a nod of
her pretty head. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t see why you are so
very interested in Mr. Glover. Every one at Lady
Nassington&#8217;s likes him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I, Sylvia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why be so mysterious?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not mysterious. I happened to have come
down to see the wireless installation here, and you are
staying at a country house in the vicinity. So I just
looked you up&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why don&#8217;t you call? I want to introduce you
to them all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I called to see you, your friend Glover,
knowing of our friendship, would, in the smoking-room,
whisper that I had followed you down here.
No. I prefer that we should preserve our secret,
Sylvia. You surely don&#8217;t want to cause your mother
annoyance and anxiety? Remember you are to marry
a man of title. At the very thought of your being
engaged to me your mother would faint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; laughed the girl, dashing aside some dead
leaves with her walking stick. &#8220;I really think she
would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, for the present, let us remain quite quiet,&#8221;
urged young Falconer. &#8220;I will see you again when
you get back to town.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few moments later, while they stood on the path
beneath the leafless trees, the young man raised her
gloved hand to his lips, and then they parted, she to
hurry on and rejoin the guns, and he to return to
Crowborough.</p>

<p>Falconer was there with a distinct purpose. He
walked back to the Beacon Hotel, ate his dinner, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
played billiards until half-past ten o&#8217;clock, when he
put on his coat and went out for a moonlight walk.
He pictured to himself the gay scene at Nassington
Hall, which he might easily have joined, yet he hesitated
because of the problem he had in hand.</p>

<p>The white moon shone brightly over the Sussex
downs as he walked along the high road to where the
wireless station was installed.</p>

<p>He called there and had another chat with the
sergeant on duty. Then he resumed his walk in the
direction of Nassington Hall.</p>

<p>When within a hundred yards of a side gate which
gave entrance to a short cut from the hall to the railway
station, he drew back under a huge thorn-bush and lit
a cigarette.</p>

<p>He wondered whether he was not making a fool of
himself. From where he stood he could see in the
distance the many lighted windows of the Hall. No
doubt, scenes of merriment were taking place within.</p>

<p>The clock of Crowborough Church chimed the hour
of one&mdash;half-past&mdash;then two o&#8217;clock. The distant
windows were still lit, and finding a fallen tree, he sat
down to contemplate.</p>

<p>Soon after two o&#8217;clock the lights in the distant
windows died away, one after another. The fun was
over. The wind blew cold, and even in his thick overcoat
he shivered. Yet when he was putting a theory to
the test in wireless or otherwise, he never begrudged
sleepless hours.</p>

<p>Just after four in the morning, while he still remained
patiently at his post, Geoffrey&#8217;s quick ear suddenly
heard the sound of approaching footsteps. Drawing
back, he watched a dark figure coming hurriedly from
the direction of the Hall, until, when it passed close
by him, he saw in the dull half-light that it was a middle-aged
countryman, evidently a local farmer who was
up and about betimes.</p>

<p>In chagrin he drew back into his place of concealment,
but a few seconds after the man had passed a
fresh thought suddenly occurred to him. So, noiselessly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
he followed the passer-by in the direction of
the station. The man, however, did not go to the
railway, but at a short distance from it he drew back
into a hedge, in order, no doubt, to wait for the first
train in the morning.</p>

<p>Geoffrey watched for a further half-hour, then withdrew
and hastened to the wireless station, whence he
called up a friend of his named Hemmington, who
lived in Hampstead, and had an amateur wireless
station there.</p>

<p>He had not repeated the amateur&#8217;s call-signal three
times before he received an answering signal, after
which his hand rapidly tapped the keys. Then a few
seconds later he received the signal, &#8220;O.K.&#8221;</p>

<p>Afterwards he returned to the Beacon Hotel, arriving
there just as the sleepy servants were astir.</p>

<p>He breakfasted early, but scarcely had he finished
when he was called by the waiter to the telephone.</p>

<p>It was Sylvia who spoke. In a state of greatest
agitation she told him that burglars had broken into
the Hall in the early hours and had stolen her mother&#8217;s
rope of pearls, worth over twenty thousand pounds,
and also nearly the whole of Madame Valdavia&#8217;s fine
jewels, which she had worn at the fancy dress dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are all horrified, Geoffrey,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Mr.
Glover has just gone out in the car to tell the police.
What can we do? Can you come up here? Mother
wants to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully sorry,&#8221; was Falconer&#8217;s reply. &#8220;Please
excuse me, as I&#8217;m terribly busy to-day. But tell your
mother, in strict secrecy, that I have a notion that she
will get her pearls back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Geoffrey?&#8221; asked the girl&#8217;s
high-pitched voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;ve said, Sylvia. Remain patient. I have
to go up to town at once. I&#8217;ll telephone you again
at two o&#8217;clock this afternoon. To-morrow I shall not
be so busy on wireless, and I&#8217;ll run down and see you
all&mdash;and also meet Mr. Glover,&#8221; he added with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>He only laughed, and put up the receiver.</p>

<p>The truth was that, owing to Geoffrey&#8217;s message to
the wireless amateur in Hampstead, the bucolic-looking
individual from Crowborough had been detained by
the police when he had stepped out of the early train
at Victoria, and upon him there had been found the
whole of the stolen property.</p>

<p>Owing to what Geoffrey was able to disclose to the
Criminal Investigation Department, a very curious
state of things became revealed.</p>

<p>It was found that the genial George Glover&mdash;who,
by the way, was promptly arrested and subsequently
extradited to Paris&mdash;was none other than the
notorious Henry Harberson, head of a great gang of
International crooks and jewel thieves, who had
recently established their temporary headquarters in
London, and who had as receiver an old Dutchman at
Utrecht named Van Hoover.</p>

<p>Thanks to Falconer&#8217;s patient investigations, extending
over a further period of some weeks, it was also rendered
clear that Harberson had, with the latest refinement
of criminality, actually established wireless communication
with each of the six members of his gang in
England, by means of a very ingenious transmitter,
the signals of which were unreadable save under certain
conditions. A man named Jensen of Copenhagen had
devised it, and that mysterious signal of four numerals
had been sent out daily just before half-past seven in
order to inform each member all was safe, and that no
police inquiry was being made.</p>

<p>The jewels had been stolen from Nassington Hall
by the pretended wealthy man, whose oil interests
in Roumania were bogus, and handed out of the conservatory
window to a confederate from New Orleans
named Blades, who was dressed for the occasion as
a Sussex farmer.</p>

<p>Both men, with two of their accomplices, who were
found in possession of secret receiving sets, were sent
over to France, and at the time of writing they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
all serving long terms of imprisonment for three
sensational jewel robberies committed there.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beverley was, however, naturally delighted to
be again in possession of her pearls, while in Geoffrey
Falconer&#8217;s private laboratory there is to-day Harberson&#8217;s
very up-to-date secret wireless set which the police
seized at the pretty house which, as George Glover,
he rented on the Thames, not far from Maidenhead.
In construction it is, after all, only a variation upon
a set previously devised in the research department
at Chelmsford, yet there are two factors in it which,
to Geoffrey, established a new theory, and which, as
will later on be apparent, were destined to be of distinct
advantage to him in his experiments and investigations
into the romance of wireless.</p>

<small>THE VOICE FROM THE VOID</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> afternoon about a month after the curious Affair
of the Secret Signal, while Geoffrey was busy conducting
some experiment in the research laboratory at
Chelmsford, a tall, well-dressed young foreigner entered,
and advancing to where he was seated, placed his hand
upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; gasped Geoffrey starting, his face lighting
with pleasure. &#8220;Why, my dear Enrico! Wherever
have you sprung from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve sent me over from Coltano about some
new apparatus, and I heard you were in here. I
arrived in London a week ago,&#8221; explained the dark,
smooth-haired young fellow, who was one of the engineers
at the powerful wireless station belonging to the Italian
Government, and whose messages, prefixed by the call-signal,
&#8220;I.C.I.,&#8221; are so well-known to all wireless men.</p>

<p>Enrico Rossi, the son of a distinguished Italian
general, had spent many years in England. He had met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Falconer during the war, when they had become fast
friends. Rossi had been attached to the Intelligence
Branch of the Italian Army, his duty being the interception
of enemy messages. Then, after peace, the
young man had resumed his responsible post at the
great wireless station in Tuscany.</p>

<p>Falconer took off his head-&#8217;phones, and learning that
his friend was returning to London at half-past five,
agreed to accompany him, so that they might dine
together at the club.</p>

<p>This they did, and afterwards Geoffrey took his
friend along to Mrs. Beverley&#8217;s in Upper Brook Street.
He had often spoken of Enrico to Sylvia&mdash;hence he
was anxious to introduce him. The South American
widow was one of those many enthusiasts who
had fallen beneath the lure of Italy, therefore both
mother and daughter made the young man most
welcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are thinking of going to Italy very soon, Mr.
Rossi,&#8221; said Mrs. Beverley, in the course of their chat
in the big, elegant drawing-room. &#8220;It is five years
since I was there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh if you come, please do not fail to let me know,&#8221;
said the good-looking young fellow, whose elegance of
manner was so typically Italian. &#8220;I am frequently
at our wireless station at San Paolo, outside Rome,
and no doubt you will go to the Eternal City.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Florence first, I think, mother,&#8221; Sylvia said.
&#8220;I want to see the Pitti and the Uffizi.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better still,&#8221; exclaimed Enrico. &#8220;I am within
a couple of hours of Firenze&mdash;or, as we call it&mdash;Firenze
la Bella.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are beginning to know quite a lot about wireless
through Mr. Falconer,&#8221; declared the popular South
American hostess. &#8220;It is all so intensely fascinating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the young Italian in very good
English. &#8220;We are constantly making fresh discoveries.
The most wonderful and important nowadays is, of
course, telephony through space.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We should have all been burned as wizards had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
we lived a few hundred years ago,&#8221; laughed Geoffrey.
&#8220;The world would have declared us capable of working
miracles&mdash;heat, motion, light and sound&mdash;created out
of nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>The young men remained smoking until Geoffrey
was compelled to scurry to catch his last train, while
Enrico Rossi left him at Liverpool Street Station to
go back to his hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be down at Chelmsford again to-morrow,&#8221;
he said on parting. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a lot of trouble with
our five-kilowatt telephone set, and we want your
people to help us out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt we can,&#8221; laughed Geoffrey. &#8220;We can
fit you up with most things in wireless at Chelmsford.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right-o!&#8221; said the Italian. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be down in
the morning. <i>Buona notte!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>And he turned and left his friend as the train moved
off.</p>

<p>Now, on Geoffrey&#8217;s return home, he found the
Professor busy writing in his study, at work on the great
book which was to be the crowning distinction of his
splendid career.</p>

<p>The courtly old man put aside his pen, and filling his
pipe, listened to his son&#8217;s account of the unexpected
arrival of Enrico, of whom he had so often spoken
since the war, and whose talents as a radio-engineer
he always praised so highly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ask him over to dine to-morrow night,&#8221; said
Geoffrey when at last they rose, for it was then past
one o&#8217;clock in the morning, and the Professor was about
to retire.</p>

<p>Before going to bed, Geoffrey passed into the room
which he had converted into an experimental laboratory.
It was his habit&mdash;as is the habit of most wireless experimenters&mdash;to
switch on the aerial and listen for a few
moments before going to bed.</p>

<p>The long-distance traffic to and from America and
Europe is always clearer and of greater interest in the
small hours of the morning than in the daytime, for
at night the electric waves carry farther, and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
converted into signals much louder and more distinct
than during the hours of light.</p>

<p>So he took up the telephones, drew down the aerial
switch, thus connecting the high twin wires across
the lawn to the instruments, and by means of another
switch put into circuit his long-wave set&mdash;the apparatus
upon which the chief high-power European stations
were received.</p>

<p>The first he heard was Moscow sending out its usual
Bolshevik propaganda&mdash;of which nobody takes any
notice&mdash;then, turning the condenser slowly, he heard
Nantes sending to Budapest. Another slight turn
and he listened to &#8220;F.L.,&#8221; (the Eiffel Tower) transmitting
upon its continuous wave&mdash;or &#8220;C.W.,&#8221; as it is
known to wireless men&mdash;to Sarajevo, in Bosnia, and
at the same time Madrid was in communication with
Poldhu, in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Strange, indeed, is the medley of messages which
flash through the ether in the starlight, unseen, unfelt,
and undetected, save by the delicate apparatus with
its row of little illuminated vacuum tubes such as
Geoffrey Falconer had there before him.</p>

<p>He was just about to lay down the telephone when,
as he turned the knob of the condenser, he suddenly
heard an unusual howl&mdash;the strong, high-pitched whistle
of a continuous-wave valve. He knew by the sound
that it was the wave of a wireless telephone, therefore
he waited and listened.</p>

<p>In a few seconds he heard a voice, deep, but not
unmusical, exclaim in Italian with great clearness&mdash;almost
as clear as that from the experimental telephone
set at Chelmsford:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hulloa! Hulloa! Hulloa! I am calling I.C.I.!
Hulloa, I.C.I.! Can you hear me? I.C.I.! I.C.I.!&#8221;
the voice kept repeating, calling Coltano, in Italy.</p>

<p>Geoffrey was greatly mystified. The note was
quite clear and distinct, though the voice was apparently
distorted. The modulation was a little faulty. But,
as an expert, he knew the great difficulties of telephony
without wires, and the thousand and one trivial things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
which are necessary for success. A loose terminal
screw; the disconnection of a single strand of wire no
thicker than a human hair; a falling accumulator,
or a &#8220;soft&#8221; valve, all too frequently undetectable,
makes the difference between failure and success.</p>

<p>There was an interval of half a minute.</p>

<p>The operator, whoever he was, who wanted Coltano,
the station a thousand miles away from Essex, was no
doubt making some adjustment.</p>

<p>At last the voice came again with startling clearness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hulloa! Hulloa! Hulloa, Coltano! Hulloa,
I.C.I.! Are you on duty, Nicola? Hulloa, Nicola!
Nicola? Nicola? Or is it Tozzoni on duty? Tozzoni?
Tozzoni? <i>Tanti saluti</i>,&#8221; the voice continued. &#8220;Listen,
Nicola. Here is Enrico Rossi!&#8221;</p>

<p>Falconer held his breath. The speech was weird,
and quite unusual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rossi calling I.C.I.&mdash;calling Nicola. Listen,
Nicola, <i>caro mio</i>! Rossi speaking. Rossi speaking.
Can you hear me?&#8221; continued the distorted voice.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Then again over the carrier-wave
of electricity ran the words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Coltano! Listen, Nicola&mdash;or Tozzoni!
Both of you are my dear friends. Enrico speaking.
I am in London&mdash;in London! With Falconer, of
Chelmsford. Can you hear that?&#8221; he shouted in a
shriller voice. &#8220;With Falconer, of Chelmsford! You
know him&mdash;both of you. Well, I&#8217;m over here in England.
But I am not coming back to Italy. My message to you
is that I am not returning. I have other plans in
America.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then there was another pause, during which Falconer
listened, silent and breathless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nicola, <i>caro mio</i>! I have other plans in America,
so I shall not return to you. <i>Tanti saluti, caro mio.</i>
Will you reply? Please reply on six thousand five
hundred mètres. I will listen. Rossi, changing
over!&#8221;</p>

<p>Falconer strained his ears to listen to the reply to
that amazing message sent by his friend whom only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
two and a half hours before, he had left at Liverpool
Street Station.</p>

<p>But though Madrid, Poldhu, Leafield, Cleethorpes,
and Aberdeen were busy to various European stations,
he could detect no reply. For quite ten minutes he
listened, until, suddenly, the powerful station at
Leafield, near Oxford, sent out the words in Morse
code:</p>

<p>&#8220;Understood&mdash;Rossi to Coltano. Good telephony.
Cannot hear Coltano.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next second another station, which he took to be
Aberdeen, sent a message:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have understood Rossi to Coltano. What is
the mystery? Have not heard Coltano&#8217;s reply. Waiting
for Coltano.&#8221;</p>

<p>But though the young experimenter listened intently
the station in Central Italy remained silent.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, he heard the well-known note
of the great Italian radio-station, which tapped out in
Morse, after giving his call-signal, &#8220;I.C.I.,&#8221; the letters
&#8220;Q.R.A.&#8221;&mdash;the conventional sign for the question:
&#8220;What is the name of your station?&#8221;</p>

<p>To this there was no reply. Half-a-dozen times
the request came from Italy, apparently for the name
of the station working telephony, though even that was
not clear. Yet, no doubt, a hundred pairs of ears were
listening in England alone. At the moment several
stations were jamming each other so badly that it
became extremely difficult to pick out the words from
Coltano.</p>

<p>Again, with almost startling distinctness, the
strong, continuous wave of electricity was heard in the
telephones, and the same voice spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is 2.C.Q., calling I.C.I. Rossi speaking.
Glad you got my message. <i>Addio!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice with its foreign accent sounded to Geoffrey
much like that of his friend, but being distorted,
recognition was not easy.</p>

<p>The whole circumstance was most puzzling, to say
the least, and Geoffrey ascended to his room wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
not so much why Enrico had so suddenly made up his
mind not to return to Italy as to the identity of the
station from which he had transmitted that telephone
message across Europe.</p>

<p>The call-signal, &#8220;2.C.Q.,&#8221; showed it to be an experimental
station, but he knew of none so powerful as to
be able to transmit telephony to Central Italy.</p>

<p>The whole affair was a complete enigma.</p>

<p>Next day he awaited the arrival of his friend at
Chelmsford, but though the hours passed, he did not
appear. The following day went by, but he neither
came nor wrote. The department at the works with
which the station had been doing business was equally
puzzled. He had ordered on behalf of the Coltano
station a quantity of new apparatus for wireless telephony,
and it was being constructed in all haste, yet
though a whole week went by, he never returned to
inspect it.</p>

<p>To his friend, Frank Boyd, Falconer told the story
of that mysterious telephone message in the night.
At first Boyd hardly gave it credence, but it was
corroborated by the operators at Poldhu, who had been
on watch at the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we must find out who &#8216;2.C.Q.&#8217; is. They
have a list of experimenters and their call-signals at
Marconi House,&#8221; Boyd said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s ring up and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>They did, and the reply received was that the station,
2.C.Q., belonged to a retired naval officer living near
Epsom Downs, a man who had experimented in wireless
for some years, but whose station was certainly not
equipped for long-distance telephony.</p>

<p>Next day Geoffrey came to London, and then went
down to Epsom, full of eagerness to solve the mystery.
The retired naval commander, a man named Kent,
received him, but at once assured him that no telephony
had been transmitted from there. He only possessed
the ordinary amateur&#8217;s set, which he showed his visitor&mdash;a
limited power of ten watts for continuous-wave
transmission. His range of transmission was probably
not more than over a ten-mile radius.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>&#8220;Have you any knowledge of a young Italian named
Enrico Rossi?&#8221; asked Geoffrey, as he stood in Mr.
Kent&#8217;s wireless room.</p>

<p>&#8220;None whatever. To my knowledge I have never
heard the name before,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>So Geoffrey was compelled to return to London,
where, on arrival, he called at the hotel near Charing
Cross which Enrico had given as his address, but to
his surprise was informed at the bureau that no person
of that name had been staying there!</p>

<p>Indeed, Falconer examined the register of visitors
himself, but found no entry of the name of Rossi,
either in the account-books of the hotel or the register
which all visitors signed when engaging rooms.</p>

<p>The mystery of Enrico&#8217;s disappearance was, in view
of that remarkable wireless message, most curious.
Why had the Italian used a false call-signal? Again,
from what station had he transmitted that message
of farewell?</p>

<p>Having obtained permission, Falconer&#8217;s next action
was to ask Coltano whether they had received the
telephonic message from their engineer on the night
in question. The message was sent from Poldhu,
while Geoffrey himself, seated at Chelmsford, listened
on the big aerial to its dispatch, and then, a quarter
of an hour later, heard the reply, which read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Poldhu from Coltano. Understood your query.
We have heard no telephony and received no message
whatever from Enrico Rossi. Why do you ask?
Kindly reply.&mdash;Director Coltano Radio.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>From that it was instantly plain that the message
purporting to be sent to Coltano was upon a low-power
set somewhere in the vicinity of London, and not,
as Geoffrey had believed, upon apparatus which would
transmit two thousand or more miles. The Admiralty
wireless station at Cleethorpes heard it, and so had
Aberdeen, but there was no proof that it had been
heard outside Britain.</p>

<p>The mystery increased hourly. The London police<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
were informed, and inquiries were made concerning
the missing Italian.</p>

<p>To Sylvia, Geoffrey had told the whole story, and
the girl had become keenly excited concerning the
disappearance of the good-mannered young man, who
was her lover&#8217;s friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can help you, Geoffrey, I do hope you will
allow me,&#8221; she urged. &#8220;I believe the poor fellow
has met with foul play, and if so, we ought to discover
the culprits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That, I regret to say, is my suspicion,&#8221; was
Falconer&#8217;s reply. &#8220;I have a keen intuition that there
is something very radically wrong somewhere. Why
should he announce his departure for America?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he has not sailed, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The police have been busy examining the list
of sailings, but his name does not appear anywhere,&#8221;
Geoffrey said. &#8220;Again,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;why should
he deceive me as to where he was staying?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot think why he was not frank and open
with you. What had he to fear?&#8221; Sylvia remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it! Perhaps he went in fear of something,
and for that reason kept his whereabouts a
secret,&#8221; said her lover as they stood together in the
pretty morning-room looking out into Upper Brook
Street. &#8220;Anyhow it&#8217;s a mystery which I intend to
solve&mdash;if possible,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>In order to try to solve it he obtained leave from
the works, and travelled first to Pisa, the old marble-built
city famous for its cathedral and leaning tower,
and then on to Coltano.</p>

<p>The director, a tall, dark-haired, rather handsome
man, received him warmly in his private office attached
to the long row of buildings which form the power-house
and operating rooms of the station.</p>

<p>When he heard the story, he exclaimed in Italian&mdash;a
language which Geoffrey knew very well:</p>

<p>&#8220;All this is most amazing&mdash;incredible!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Signor Rossi was sent to Chelmsford to obtain certain
new apparatus, and in his last report, ten days ago, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
wrote that all was in hand, and that he hoped to
be back in a fortnight&#8217;s time. Why should he go to
America?&#8221; asked the director, shrugging his shoulders
significantly. &#8220;I cannot believe it! We can only
leave it to the police. He has a brother living in
Firenze.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes!&#8221; exclaimed Geoffrey. &#8220;I have heard
him speak of him. He is an advocate, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. A very nice fellow. He lives in the Via
Giotto.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go and see him,&#8221; the young Englishman
said, and that same night he left for the Lily City.</p>

<p>Next day he called upon the advocate, and made
inquiry regarding his brother. Signor Rossi, however,
replied that he had heard nothing of him since his
departure for London.</p>

<p>Then Falconer retold the strange story of the amazing
farewell message, and his subsequent disappearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you offer any suggestion concerning the extraordinary
precaution he took to mislead me as to where
he was staying in London?&#8221; inquired Geoffrey.</p>

<p>The advocate reflected.</p>

<p>&#8220;He may have been in fear of some enemy or other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he had enemies?&#8221; asked the Englishman
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! That I cannot tell. If he had, he never
mentioned them to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither did he to me,&#8221; Falconer said. &#8220;But he
was the last man in the world to have enemies, I should
have thought. The police have taken up the inquiry,
and one of the reasons I am here is to obtain his photograph&mdash;if
you have one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fortunately I have a recent one. He sent it to
me from Rome six months ago,&#8221; answered Enrico&#8217;s
brother, who produced from a drawer a good cabinet
portrait.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; exclaimed Falconer. &#8220;We will reproduce
it and circulate it as soon as I get back to London.
Poor Enrico! There can be no doubt that he has
fallen a victim of some very cleverly-conceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
plot. I only hope I shall be successful in unravelling
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sincerely hope so too, signore,&#8221; said the advocate,
and later on Falconer left him, departing that same day
for London, travelling by way of Milan and the Gothard.</p>

<p>On opening the London newspaper, which he bought
on Folkestone Pier when he landed, his eyes met a
startling headline, and he sat in his corner seat in
the boat-train, aghast as he read the amazing announcement.</p>

<p>On the previous day, it was stated, three men from
a well-known furniture depository went with the key
to a flat in Longton Mansions, Bayswater, to remove
the furniture into storage, its owner, Mrs. Priestley,
having gone to Buenos Ayres for a year to join her
husband, who had an appointment out there.</p>

<p>On entering the flat, they first commenced removing
the furniture from the drawing-room and dining-room.
Then they cleared out two bedrooms, when
one of the men, unlocking the door of a small box-room,
the key of which was in the door, was startled at finding
a man huddled up inside! A few seconds sufficed to
show that he was dead&mdash;and had no doubt been dead
some days!</p>

<p>At once the police had been called, care being taken
to hide the gruesome discovery from other tenants
of the flats. The body was brought out, and the
detective-inspector of the Division, on seeing it, identified
the body as that of a young man named Enrico
Rossi, an Italian engineer, who had been reported
missing. The report concluded with the usual cryptic
assurance that the police had the matter in hand.</p>

<p>Geoffrey sat staggered. His worst fears were now
realised. His friend Enrico had, no doubt, been done
to death!</p>

<p>On arrival at Victoria Station, he drove at once to
Scotland Yard, where he interviewed Superintendent
Ransley, the same official with whom the affair of the
Secret Signals had brought him into contact. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to him he gave the photograph of the dead man, which
he had brought from Italy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Falconer, the whole circumstances are
an enigma,&#8221; the superintendent told him as they sat
together in the rather barely-furnished room. &#8220;We are
now in search of the woman named Priestley. Yet
as far as I can gather, she is a most respectable lady.
Her husband has recently obtained a post as vice-consul
at San Cristobal, and she stored her furniture
in order to join him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where is she now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On her way to Buenos Ayres perhaps. I hope
to know to-morrow if she has sailed. But whether
she has or not, we shall no doubt eventually find her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And arrest her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;providing the coroner&#8217;s jury bring in a verdict
of wilful murder. And they must, for he was struck a
heavy blow on the head by a piece of iron piping.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later Falconer stood by the body of his friend,
who was dressed just as he had been when they parted
at Liverpool Street. Indeed he was still wearing his
light overcoat, showing that he had been killed either
on arrival at the flat or upon his departure.</p>

<p>Naturally Geoffrey was greatly perturbed, and eager
to discover the woman in whose apartment Enrico
had been assassinated. Next day the motive of the
crime was established&mdash;robbery. His wallet was
missing! That he had carried one Geoffrey knew,
because he had produced it to pay for his railway-fare
from Chelmsford to London. It was a dark-red one,
and seemed well-filled with Treasury notes.</p>

<p>In due course, the inquest was held, and though
Geoffrey gave evidence of identification, he refrained,
at the suggestion of Superintendent Ransley, from
telling the jury of that remarkable telephonic message
of farewell to which he had listened. The jury returned
their verdict, and left the police to solve the mystery
and arrest the woman Priestley.</p>

<p>But though they made every inquiry, no trace could
be found of her. The firm of furniture removers stated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
that she had called one day and asked them to remove
her furniture and store it, handed the key of the flat to
the clerk, showed him a receipt for the last quarter&#8217;s
rent, and gave him a cheque for fifty pounds on account.
She told him that she was going abroad, and would
probably be away for a year at least. A receipt was
given, and the men, going to carry out the work of
removal, made the sensational discovery.</p>

<p>About a month went by. The body of poor Enrico
had been buried at Geoffrey&#8217;s expense, and though the
latter continued his research work at Chelmsford, his
thoughts were ever centred upon the mysterious Mrs.
Priestley.</p>

<p>One day Superintendent Ransley received information
that an Englishwoman named Priestley, who
answered the description of the missing woman, was
staying at the Hôtel des Indes at the Hague. A few
hours later a detective-inspector armed with a request
for arrest and extradition, left London on his way to
Holland <i>via</i> Harwich, and six days later Mrs. Priestley
was at Bow Street Police Station, where she was interrogated
by Superintendent Ransley, who, of course,
first cautioned her that whatever she might say would
be taken down and might be used as evidence against her.</p>

<p>The charge that she had been guilty of murdering
Enrico Rossi had, it seemed, from the first staggered
her. She had protested her innocence over and over
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew this Signor Enrico Rossi?&#8221; said the
superintendent, looking up from the pocket-book in
which he had been writing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I did&mdash;in Italy long ago,&#8221; was her reply.
&#8220;I was born in Italy, though my parents were English,
and I first knew him in Ancona when quite a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He called to visit you at Longton Mansions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wrote saying he would call, and asked me to
name a day. But I was much engaged, and neglected
to write to him. He, therefore, never visited me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how came he to be found murdered in your
flat?&#8221; asked the superintendent coldly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>&#8220;Ah! That I cannot tell. It is a mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; grunted Ransley, &#8220;I agree&mdash;it is! But it
would not be a mystery if you told me the truth, Mrs.
Priestley. You surely cannot expect us to give credence
to your denial?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told the truth,&#8221; was the woman&#8217;s firm
reply. &#8220;I have never set eyes upon Enrico Rossi
since a month before the war. I then met him in
Pisa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was anyone else in your flat on the night in
question?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody. My maid, Axford, had gone home to
Taunton three days before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What time did you return home on that night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had been to a dance, and it must have been
nearly three o&#8217;clock before I got back. Now that I
recollect, I am horrified to think that I actually slept
in the flat within a few feet of the dead body of the
man I had known so well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; remarked Ransley in his curious cold tone
of disbelief. &#8220;Quite naturally.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a few minutes later the woman who had denied
all knowledge of the affair was sent back to her cell,
and the superintendent gave orders for her to be brought
before the magistrate next morning and charged with
the murder of Enrico Rossi.</p>

<p>This was done, and the evening newspapers were
full of the sensational affair, though, owing to certain
circumstances, it was not deemed wise by the
authorities to let the public know the exact problem.
Hence the case was camouflaged. There were certain
interests at stake which apparently puzzled even the
Home Office.</p>

<p>Eva Priestley, represented by a well-known Bow
Street solicitor, who offered no defence, was remanded.
Her husband was communicated with, but he knew
nothing, and was, no doubt, astounded at the discovery,
and mystified regarding the young man Rossi.</p>

<p>A week later the prisoner, a tall, fair-haired woman,
whose photograph, in due course, appeared in all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
picture-papers, and whom readers of this present
narrative must well remember under another name,
was committed for trial at the Old Bailey upon the
capital charge, the Public Prosecutor alleging that she
had enticed the young fellow to her flat, and had
murdered him for the contents of his wallet.</p>

<p>Geoffrey Falconer agreed with Superintendent Ransley
and with the eminent King&#8217;s Counsel who prosecuted.
The admission of Mrs. Priestley that she and Enrico
were old friends was surely most damning evidence.</p>

<p>Not until several days after Mrs. Priestley had been
sent for trial was a curious fact noticed concerning
the blue serge jacket which poor Enrico wore at the
time he lost his life. Inside the collar the tab, bearing
the name of the tailor in Rome who had made the suit,
had been hastily cut aside, and beneath it a slit had
been made, apparently with a sharp knife. But
whether this had been done during Rossi&#8217;s lifetime
or after death could not be established.</p>

<p>One of the strangest features of the affair, however,
was that weird message by radio-telephone&mdash;a message
spoken, no doubt, by one aware of the fact that Enrico
had been done to death. The police inquiries, however,
failed to elicit any proof that the woman suspected
of the crime had any connection with anybody
acquainted with wireless, even in its most amateur form.</p>

<p>Obsessed by the mystery, Geoffrey had many conversations
concerning it with Sylvia, who believed in
Mrs. Priestley&#8217;s innocence notwithstanding the chain of
circumstantial evidence and the fact that the body
had been hidden in her flat. But if Mrs. Priestley
had not murdered the young man, who had? asked
the Public Prosecutor.</p>

<p>The day fixed for the trial of the alleged murderess
was approaching, when one afternoon Geoffrey, revisiting
unexpectedly the scene of the tragedy as he
had done several times, chanced to pass on the stairs
a short, lean, white-haired little man who was ascending
to the flat above. Their eyes met, and the old man,
turning his head, quickened his pace.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>Geoffrey recollected having met him before in those
days when Venice was seriously threatened by the
Austrian advance. His name was Nocera, and he was
a banker in Venice&mdash;a man of considerable repute.
Why, Geoffrey wondered, was he living at Longton
Mansions?</p>

<p>Of the hall-porter he later on learnt that Mr. Nocera
and his wife had occupied the flat above Mrs. Priestley&#8217;s
for about three months. They came from Italy and
took it furnished. After a month they had as guest
a Mr. Zuccari, described by the hall-porter as a tall,
thin, athletic man, with a black moustache and very
bald head.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was something of a mystery, and I was very
glad when he left,&#8221; the man declared. &#8220;One day,
indeed, I found him trying the door of Mrs. Priestley&#8217;s
flat with the latchkey of the flat above. I caught him
unexpectedly, and he certainly did not like it, for three
days later he left, and I haven&#8217;t seen him since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s curious,&#8221; Falconer remarked. &#8220;Very
curious! Was he really trying to get into her flat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seemed to me that he was. But, of course, my
presence prevented him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later that evening Geoffrey related to Superintendent
Ransley what he had learnt, but strangely enough the
Venice banker and his wife left early next morning,
taking with them two good-sized trunks. To the
porter they remarked that they were going to Edinburgh,
but the man was pretty wide awake, and giving
the taxi-driver a quiet hint, heard from him an hour
later that he had driven them to Victoria, to the Continental
train.</p>

<p>Quickly observation was kept upon the pair, and
at Folkestone the passport which they presented as
Italian subjects was declared by the passport officer
to be out of order, a fact which necessitated them both
returning to London, though quite unconscious that
they were under suspicion.</p>

<p>At the same time, after closely questioning the
hall-porter, Superintendent Ransley gave instructions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
that active search should be made for the bald-headed
guest who had been tampering with the lock of Mrs.
Priestley&#8217;s flat. Then there was a further surprise,
and Mrs. Priestley herself, questioned in prison, admitted
she knew the people in the flat above,
and being Italians, they had once or twice visited her.
At once the police, aided by Geoffrey, redoubled their
efforts, Falconer being at last successful in obtaining
a further piece of curious evidence. He had taken
the key of Mrs. Priestley&#8217;s flat to a number of locksmiths
in order to ascertain if they had been asked
to make a similar key, but in vain. Of a sudden,
however, he recollected having seen a barrow full of
old keys and rusty locks in Lower Marsh, Lambeth,
and upon it a notice bearing the words: &#8220;Keys cut
at shortest notice.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the owner of the barrow he showed the key.
The man&mdash;an artist in his profession&mdash;examined it
long and carefully, until he found scratched upon it
in tiny figures a number. He referred to a book, and
then replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I cut a duplicate of this for a tall, thin
gentleman. He was a foreigner, I remember.&#8221; And
he gave the date, three days before the disappearance
of Enrico Rossi.</p>

<p>This was a very valuable link in the chain of fresh
evidence, and the police very wisely allowed the supposed
Venice banker and his wife to leave for Paris, entirely
unsuspicious of the fact that they were being closely
watched. The day came for the trial of Mrs. Priestley,
but it was postponed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile two English detectives were in Paris
watching Nocera and his wife, information from Venice
concerning the &#8220;banker&#8221; having been the reverse of
reassuring.</p>

<p>Within three weeks Superintendent Ransley&#8217;s expectations
were rewarded. The man Zuccari visited
them at their hotel in the Rue Castiglione!</p>

<p>From that moment Zuccari was never left, and four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
days later all three were arrested in the street near the
Opera by six agents of the Sûreté.</p>

<p>Madame Nocera was released, but her husband,
in order to save himself, made a statement to Inspector
Peyron when taken to the bureau of police. In a great
state of agitation he admitted that, while posing as a
banker in Venice, the money he possessed belonged
to the Austrian Government&mdash;in fact, he was the paymaster
of the spies of Austria scattered through northern
Italy during the war. He declared that he had had
no hand whatever in the assassination of Enrico
Rossi.</p>

<p>The French police were, however, far from satisfied
with this statement, and pressed him, under threats,
for further information. It then became apparent
that Nocera and Zuccari had quarrelled over their
share of the spoils, and in the end Nocera explained
the ingenious plot to Inspector Peyron and the two men
from Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>It had become known to Zuccari that Enrico Rossi
was to be sent on business from the Coltano wireless
station to England, and that he intended to call upon
Mrs. Priestley, his old friend. The flat above the
latter&#8217;s being to let furnished, the Noceras took it,
and succeeded in cultivating friendly relations with
the lady below. Then Zuccari arrived from Italy,
and on one of his visits with Nocera to Mrs. Priestley,
he succeeded in getting hold of the latchkey of the flat
used by the servant. Of this he had a duplicate made
in Lower Marsh, and then he waited in patience.</p>

<p>Enrico arrived in London and wrote to Mrs. Priestley.
She quite innocently mentioned this fact to Nocera,
and said that she could not see him as she was going
away.</p>

<p>This was their opportunity. Entering the flat in
Mrs. Priestley&#8217;s absence, Zuccari discovered Enrico&#8217;s
letter, and his address at a small private hotel at
Kensington.</p>

<p>He ascertained that Mrs. Priestley would be out at
a dance on a certain evening; therefore he telegraphed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in the lady&#8217;s name asking Enrico to call at half-past
ten o&#8217;clock for supper.</p>

<p>After leaving Falconer at Liverpool Street station,
Enrico had therefore taken a taxi direct to Longton
Mansions, where Zuccari was already in Mrs. Priestley&#8217;s
flat awaiting him. On entering there the unsuspecting
young Italian was struck down, his wallet taken and
his jacket removed. From a little pocket behind the
silk address-tab of the tailor, Something was extracted&mdash;a
tiny book of thin India paper.</p>

<p>That Something was of the greatest value to the
murderer, and was the motive of the crime, for it
contained the secret wireless code of the Italian Government,
both military and diplomatic, and would be of
inestimable value to the Austrians and Germans, even
though peace had now been declared.</p>

<p>Having secured that for which he had cunningly
plotted, Zuccari had replaced the coat upon the inert
body of the man he had beaten to death with a piece
of iron piping, put on his overcoat, and then locked
him in the small box-room, afterwards leaving the flat.
Three hours or so later Mrs. Priestley returned, all
unconscious of the tragedy, and slept there for the last
night before her departure abroad.</p>

<p>The London police, two days after the true facts
had been ascertained in Paris and Mrs. Priestley had
been released, visited the flat occupied by Nocera,
for, on inquiry, they had elicited the fact that, as secret
agent of Austria in Venice, he had had much technical
instruction in the use of wireless.</p>

<p>In the flat was found quite a powerful generating
plant, with a very up-to-date telephone set, and a most ingenious
aerial arrangement by which one could transmit
upon quite a long wave-length. Why this had originally
been installed was obscure, but it was believed to be
one of the powerful secret sets used by German spies
in London during the war.</p>

<p>In any case, it was proved that the reason Enrico
had not given his correct address was because he had
apprehensions of some sinister attempt. It was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
proved that Zuccari had, after the tragedy, spoken into
the microphone that weird message to which Geoffrey
had listened, and which proved such a remarkable
feature of the affair. The message of farewell had
apparently been the curious fancy of the unscrupulous
assassin.</p>

<p>The stolen code-book was recovered three days after
Zuccari&#8217;s arrest from his baggage at the left-luggage
office at Brussels, whence it was his intention to convey
it to Germany. The Italian Government, who had
two years before issued warrants for the arrest of both
Zuccari and the traitor Nocera, at once claimed their
extradition, and both men are now serving a sentence
of solitary confinement for life&mdash;a doom worse, indeed,
than the gallows.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE CALICO GLOVE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Beverley,</span> who, on account of her reckless
expenditure, had been nicknamed &#8220;The Wild Widow&#8221;
by a certain set in Society, had gone up to Perthshire
to join a gay house-party at a shooting lodge near
Crieff, leaving Sylvia at home at Upper Brook Street.</p>

<p>After the girl there was dangling a Peer of the Realm,
twice her age, in the person of Viscount Hendlewycke,
a penniless man, whose family tree ran back to the days
of Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion, and who, in his youth, had
been distinguished by his two appearances in the
Divorce Court as co-respondent.</p>

<p>Hendlewycke, with his bald head and his pretence
to golf, was the best fish that Mrs. Beverley had
captured as the prospective husband of Sylvia.
Hendlewycke Castle, near Alnwick, in Northumberland,
was a magnificent old place, now let by the Viscount&#8217;s
trustee in Bankruptcy to a Lancashire cotton-waste
dealer who aspired to a baronetcy, and Mrs. Beverley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
with her acuteness and her wealth, saw that she
could easily reinstate &#8220;Roddy,&#8221; as he was known
in society, providing he made Sylvia Lady Hendlewycke.</p>

<p>Such an event would be the crowning of her great
social ambitions in London.</p>

<p>Sylvia, however, was not blind. Neither was
Geoffrey Falconer. Geoffrey had met &#8220;Roddy&#8221;
several times. In him the young man found a degenerate
<i>roué</i>, who, having run through his fortune, had also
so lost his self-respect that he would borrow a &#8220;fiver&#8221;
from all and sundry, and in most cases forget to pay it
back. Of club and hotel servants he had been driven
to borrow money, and to a dozen butlers in country
houses he was indebted for &#8220;just a couple of quid for
my railway fare. I&#8217;ll send it back to you when I get
up to town.&#8221;</p>

<p>To men at White&#8217;s, the Wellington, Wells&#8217;, the
Devonshire, and Boodles, &#8220;Roddy&#8221; Hendlewycke
was known as &#8220;a bad egg.&#8221; Why &#8220;The Wild Widow&#8221;
from Argentina had taken him under her wing, nobody
could imagine&mdash;except, of course, she wanted an old
title for her daughter.</p>

<p>Sylvia was compelled to tolerate him in order not
openly to offend her mother, but she was heartily sick
of him, and was seen as little as possible in his company.
With Geoffrey she was perfectly frank, and they
entirely understood each other. Therefore, it was
not at all surprising that one day, her mother being
absent, she suggested to the young man that he should
drive her out for the day in her mother&#8217;s big cream-coloured
Rolls-Royce.</p>

<p>The suggestion was at once adopted, and on the
Saturday morning the pair left London for a day&#8217;s
outing.</p>

<p>The car had scarcely left the garage at the rear of
South Audley Street, where, with others belonging to
people in the neighbourhood, it was kept, when a well-dressed
man of about forty entered the yard and
approaching the man in charge, exclaimed:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>&#8220;I see Mrs. Beverley&#8217;s Royce has just gone out.
Did you get to know what I want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; replied the man. &#8220;Young Mr. Falconer
is driving Miss Beverley down to Hastings. They&#8217;re
lunching at the Queen&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite sure, sir,&#8221; was the reply, whereupon the
stranger placed a Treasury note into the hand of his
informant.</p>

<p>Then, re-entering a taxi in which he had been seated,
apparently watching Falconer drive out Mrs. Beverley&#8217;s
car, he sped along to a garage in Knightsbridge, where
another large open car awaited him, and even before
Sylvia and her lover had left Upper Brook Street the
mysterious watcher was well on his way out of
London.</p>

<p>The day was a lovely one in early autumn, and the
drive through Kent was delightful. Geoffrey and
Sylvia came along the sea-front at St. Leonard&#8217;s just
before noon, and, continuing, pulled up at the back
entrance of the Queen&#8217;s Hotel, where they ordered lunch.
Then, after a wash, they strolled out into the autumn
sunshine beside the sea.</p>

<p>As they left by that door with its wide glass porch
which leads out upon the terrace before the sea, they
passed a man seated in one of the wicker lounge chairs,
smoking a good cigar.</p>

<p>He was the mysterious individual who had been so
keen to ascertain the destination of the pair. But
as they passed he was gazing thoughtfully out upon
the sea, taking no notice of them.</p>

<p>After they had gone along towards the Pier, he returned
to the lounge, where he scribbled a telegram. Having
done so, he apparently desired to alter it, so he tore it
into tiny fragments, half of which he tossed into the
waste-paper basket, and the other half he placed in
the pocket of his grey tweed jacket. That action showed
him first to be a man of method, and secondly that
the message was one which he did not wish to be read
by anyone who might perhaps be watching.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>He wrote a second telegram, and that he took across
to the post-office and dispatched.</p>

<p>Later, when Geoffrey and Sylvia, having eaten their
luncheon in the big upstairs room, had descended to
the little lounge on the terrace to take their coffee,
they found the same man there, smoking a cigar in the
same abstracted manner.</p>

<p>Coffee was brought to the pair who were chattering
merrily, when the stranger, suddenly rising to pass
back into the lounge, struck the little table accidentally
and the coffee was spilled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; he exclaimed, with exquisite politeness, in
a well-modulated and refined voice. &#8220;Do please
forgive me! It was most clumsy of me, and I apologise
to you both.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then seeing the waiter in the vicinity, he ordered
two more coffees in the same breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing!&#8221; laughed Falconer. &#8220;It was only an
accident! These tables are all gingerbread things.
They are always very shaky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the stranger, &#8220;my sole consolation is
that none of it went on the lady&#8217;s dress. Coffee stains
badly, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. It&#8217;s quite all right!&#8221; declared Sylvia
pleasantly.</p>

<p>And then they began to chat. The stranger told
them that he had motored down from London just for
a breath of air.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going abroad&mdash;to China&mdash;in about a month&#8217;s
time. I expect to be away several years. So I want
to see all I can of our dear old England before I go.&#8221;</p>

<p>For half an hour they gossiped of motors, of good
and indifferent roads, and of hotels as known by motorists
within a couple of hundred miles of London.</p>

<p>At half-past three Sylvia suggested they should
start back home; therefore, they parted from their
pleasant chance acquaintance, leaving him still smoking
in the porch-like lounge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I somehow don&#8217;t like that man, Geoffrey,&#8221; the
girl said as soon as she was seated beside him and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
car turned out into the busy Hastings street. &#8220;He
seemed so inquisitive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so, too. But probably he wanted to
know who we were,&#8221; laughed Falconer. &#8220;Though
he got no change out of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice that he wore, even at lunch, a glove
upon his left hand? I think it is to cover some deformity.
It seemed to be of unbleached calico, and
covered with some kind of flesh-coloured paint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I noticed it. But by his manner and speech
he seems a gentleman&mdash;and a thorough cosmopolitan,
without a doubt. He has apparently been half over
the world,&#8221; he replied, and then the conversation
dropped as he quickened speed to overtake a tram-car.</p>

<p>That same night the stranger, who wore the flesh-coloured
calico glove, attired in a dinner-jacket, lounged
about the entrance-hall of the Piccadilly Grill for about
a quarter of an hour, until at last he was joined by the
person for whom he had been waiting, a smartly-dressed
French girl, who possessed all the <i>chic</i> and mannerisms
of the true Parisienne. Having left her cloak, the
pair went in and dined at a <i>table à deux</i>, which had been
reserved for them in a corner.</p>

<p>The waiter, apparently knowing them both as regular
patrons of the place, served them well. Over the table
the man in a low tone related the coffee incident at
Hastings, and the girl seemed to regard the adventure
as huge fun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Teddy, I do wish I had been with you!&#8221;
the girl said in rather broken English. &#8220;<i>Mon Dieu!</i>
I&#8217;ve had a dull, miserable day! I went up to Hampstead
to see George, but he has gone away, and his
landlady says she has no idea when he will be back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s sudden,&#8221; exclaimed the man, knitting his
brows. &#8220;I wonder if anything has happened? George
was not due to leave London till next Saturday morning&mdash;and
then he was going over to Stockholm on a very
important little bit of business. I arranged it all
only yesterday. And now he&#8217;s gone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And the old woman did not seem to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
anything. Mr. Jordon had, she said, left very hurriedly
with only a suit-case. And he left no message either
for you or for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks a bit fishy, Gabrielle,&#8221; the man remarked,
staring at the tablecloth.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. There&#8217;s no fear, my dear Teddy,&#8221; laughed
the girl. &#8220;If anything were wrong we should know.
Bad news travels fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like George Jordon leaving suddenly like
that&mdash;without a word. The other business in Stockholm
is a pretty big one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you fix Saturday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fixed any Saturday&mdash;the Saturday when we may
find it most convenient to all parties concerned,&#8221; he
said with a mysterious grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope neither Falconer nor the girl suspects,&#8221;
the girl said apprehensively.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can they suspect?&#8221; asked the man. &#8220;You
have only to carry out your part of the contract, and
the whole thing is easy&mdash;big money awaits both of us,&#8221;
he whispered across the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the girl replied, her voice lost in the strains
of the orchestra. She looked across the spacious
restaurant dreamily. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;but
somehow I don&#8217;t like this business at all. George
may have smelt a rat and bolted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may have done, but, recollect, he would not
have disappeared without first sending me warning.
Remember all that it means to him&mdash;and to us both,&#8221;
exclaimed the man who was known in the haunts about
Piccadilly Circus as Teddy Tressider, or Everard, as
was his real name.</p>

<p>&#8220;On any Saturday,&#8221; repeated the pretty young
French girl, as she sipped her wine and then leaned
her bare elbows upon the table, looking straight at the
man before her. &#8220;George has arranged to be ready
to get across to Sweden, on any Saturday&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. And look here, Gabrielle!&#8221; exclaimed
the keen-eyed man, whose attitude suddenly altered
to one of menace, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you at the last moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to become chicken-hearted or&mdash;or, by Heaven! if
there&#8217;s a failure, you&#8217;ll pay dearly for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl remained silent. The expression upon
her face showed that she resented the man&#8217;s threat.
Her delicate lips compressed, and her dark eyes flashed
back at him viciously. But she was a clever girl,
for at that moment of her anger rising she controlled
her tongue, and, instead of expressing any resentment,
she only gave vent to a half-idiotic laugh, and after a
pause lifted her glass again, and answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, my dear Teddy, you are very funny to-night.
Come back to earth, my dear friend!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man with the calico glove snapped a word in
reply and ordered liqueurs, after which he took her in
a taxi to a big dancing-hall out at Hammersmith,
where, after a number of dances, they parted upon
the kerb outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, Gabrielle, if you fail me in this, I&#8217;ll
tell what I know. And you surely fully realise where
you will be,&#8221; he said distinctly in her ear as they awaited
a taxi. &#8220;I have no wish for us to be enemies. But,
gad! if you hold back, then I shall treat you as an
enemy, and I shall tell all I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl drew a long breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you&#8212;&#8212;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the words died upon her lips. With her woman&#8217;s
innate cleverness she made resolution at that moment
that she would combat the plans of the man who held
her future in his hands.</p>

<p>She recollected all the past, and she shuddered.</p>

<p>Next second, however, she laughed saucily, and as
the taxi drew up, she replied in French:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! my dear old friend, why make all this trouble?
You are very amusing to-night! This little affair will
come out all right, never fear. Now that you know
Monsieur Falconer, surely the trouble is half over?
The rest is so very easy. Discretion and caution are
all that is necessary. And then, when the deed is done,
George will slip over to Stockholm and every one will
be happy&mdash;except Monsieur Falconer!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>And she stepped into the taxi and drove away.</p>

<p>About this time Geoffrey Falconer was busy each
evening in devising improvements in his new seven-valve
amplifier, with the object of applying for a patent.
In the world of wireless there were many rumours that
Falconer&#8217;s improvement of the &#8220;saturation device&#8221;
and other things would revolutionise the present method
of the reception of wireless signals. What it exactly
was only the clever young inventor himself knew. He
had shown it to his father, and also to Sylvia, but
they were not sufficiently acquainted with the mysteries
of wireless to understand its true import.</p>

<p>So busy was Geoffrey, both at the Works at Chelmsford,
and at his own home each evening, that during
the fortnight that followed he only went to London
once, to do business at Marconi House and afterwards
to see Sylvia.</p>

<p>That evening, Mrs. Beverley being out of town, he
took her daughter out to dinner at the Carlton, and
afterwards to the theatre. During the <i>entr&#8217;acte</i> he left
her in the stalls while he went out to smoke a cigarette.
He chanced to be standing in the crowded lounge
when suddenly he saw a young man named Hugh Carew,
who had been a brother-officer with him in France.
With him was a pretty, smartly-dressed girl with dark
hair and wonderful eyes, and wearing a dress of
emerald green.</p>

<p>Carew greeted his friend warmly, and then, turning
to his companion, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me introduce you to Mr. Falconer&mdash;Mademoiselle
Juvanon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl started, held her breath, glanced furtively
into Falconer&#8217;s face, and then expressed in French
her great pleasure at meeting her companion&#8217;s brother-officer.</p>

<p>As for Geoffrey he said but little. After a few
moments&#8217; conversation, however, Carew excused himself,
saying that he wanted to get a drink, and begged
Falconer to look after the girl for a moment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>The instant he had gone to the bar, Falconer bent
to the girl, and in a low, hard voice, said in French:</p>

<p>&#8220;When last I had the pleasure of meeting
mademoiselle, both her nationality and her name
were&mdash;well&mdash;slightly different&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>From her pretty lips rang out a ripple of merry
laughter, while over her face spread a saucy look.</p>

<p>&#8220;I freely admit it, M&#8217;sieur Falconer,&#8221; she responded.
&#8220;But I had no idea we should meet here. Or I should
not have come&mdash;I confess to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Mademoiselle, beauty such as yours cannot
be concealed,&#8221; said the young man laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you flatter me?&mdash;You?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely I may be permitted to admire you&mdash;even
though I am aware of the truth&mdash;of who and what you
really are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but you will not give me away to Hugh&mdash;will
you, M&#8217;sieur Geoffrey?&#8221; she asked quickly, her
face instantly pale in alarm. &#8220;<i>I&mdash;I love him. I
swear I do!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you play the straight game with him, Gabrielle,
I will remain silent,&#8221; Falconer promised. &#8220;After we
had met in Paris three years ago, I learnt the truth
about you, mademoiselle,&#8221; he added; &#8220;and I confess
that the revelation was an extremely unpleasant one.
I believed in you, but I found that you were playing
a very crooked game.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the words left his lips, Hugh Carew returned.
The curtain had rung up, therefore Geoffrey bowed to
mademoiselle, and at once rejoined Sylvia.</p>

<p>The remainder of the play did not interest him.
As he sat by Sylvia&#8217;s side a flood of bitter memories
overtook him&mdash;how he had first been introduced to
Gabrielle while taking a morning <i>apératif</i> at the Pré
Catalan, in Paris; of his friendship with her, and of
the subsequent discovery that, instead of being what
she had represented herself to be, she was actually
the decoy of thieves! In Paris he had known her as
Gabrielle Valeri, a native of Palermo, in Sicily. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that she was in London, the friend of Hugh Carew, her
name had become Juvanon, and she was French.</p>

<p>What deep game was being played?</p>

<p>He made a point of finding Carew at his club three
days later, when he turned the conversation to her.
Hugh at once became enthusiastic. It was quite
apparent that he was over head and ears in love with the
pretty young French girl. He had, it seemed, first
met her in Rouen during the war, and had again
encountered her six months ago by pure accident while
walking along Kensington High Street. To a man in
love it is useless to give warning, and Falconer, realising
this, hesitated to say anything to the girl&#8217;s detriment.</p>

<p>He had warned her in all seriousness that if she
played a crooked game he would expose her. And he
now recollected that the expression in her eyes when she
had confessed her love for Hugh was one of true honesty
and frankness.</p>

<p>Carew was, of course, in entire ignorance that his
friend was acquainted with the girl whose beauty had
cast a spell over him, and Geoffrey, on his part, remained
silent.</p>

<p>His interview over a whisky-and-soda at the
Wellington Club that afternoon proved that the pair
were genuinely in love with each other. But Falconer,
recollecting Gabrielle&#8217;s position, was wondering what
could be behind it all. Hugh Carew was heir to a
baronetcy, the elder son of a very wealthy man, and
he wondered whether those mysterious international
thieves behind Gabrielle were not scheming blackmail.
Indeed, the future extortion of money seemed to be
at the root of it all.</p>

<p>That night, after calling at Upper Brook Street
for half an hour, Geoffrey went back to Warley full of
grave apprehensions concerning his brother-officer,
and, before turning in, he sat down to further test his
improved amplifier by which signals from both low and
high-power stations came in with almost double strength.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hitherto there have been three grades of amplifiers,&#8221;
he muttered to himself, as he sat with the low-resistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
telephones over his ears. &#8220;They have never yet
invented an amplifying detector to cover all wave-lengths
from three hundred to seventeen thousand.
We constructed one which was equally effective on all
commercial wave-lengths, but complications had to
be introduced which rendered the instrument entirely
unsuitable for ordinary practical use. Yet here I
have, I hope, a device which increases the amplitude
of the oscillations over all wave-lengths, both for
&#8216;spark&#8217; or &#8216;continuous waves.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>He listened on the telephones to the usual traffic
of the night. Many of the messages passing and
re-passing across the Atlantic were in code&mdash;messages
of mystery all of them. The rapidity of the exchange
of communications by wireless&mdash;both private and
commercial&mdash;has long out-distanced the old-fashioned
cables, with their long delay and deliberate methods.
Truly, the world is now beginning to realise that it can
send messages across the seven seas and receive replies
by wireless in half the time occupied by the submarine
cables.</p>

<p>Geoffrey remained with the telephones over his ears
for quite an hour, making delicate adjustments here
and there, his new instrument being so sensitive that
he could hear many amateurs in London working on
their ten watts and one hundred and eighty mètres
to which the General Post Office restricts them. Then
he switched off and retired to bed.</p>

<p>Four days went by&mdash;strenuous days&mdash;for at Chelmsford
important tests were being made upon the great
high-power wireless telephone set with its huge panel
with globular glass valves, each the size of a football&mdash;the
set which the collective brains of the Marconi
Company had devised in order to exchange actual
speech with stations across the Atlantic. Geoffrey
was one of the engineers engaged in these tests, hence
he had little time for anything else. He snatched his
lunch hastily each day in the comfortable upstairs
dining-room of the heads of departments, and under
the chief telephone engineer, whose clear, deliberate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
voice is known to all wireless men, devoted every
moment to his particular sphere in the perfection of
the new apparatus which was to supersede the dot-and-dash
of Morse&#8217;s invention.</p>

<p>One evening, after leaving Chelmsford, he went on
to London, and having dressed at the club, dined at
Upper Brook Street. Mrs. Beverley was giving a
small dance in honour of a French Minister of State
and his wife, and Sylvia had pressed him to come.
Hence he spent an enjoyable evening, in which the
only jarring note was the presence of the ineffable
Lord Hendlewycke, to whom, of course, Sylvia was
forced to be polite.</p>

<p>Falconer left Liverpool Street station by the last
train, arriving home at about one o&#8217;clock in the morning.
Contrary to his habit, he did not go into his wireless
room, but went straight up to bed, for the Professor
had already retired, and the old house was in darkness.</p>

<p>At seven o&#8217;clock the next morning the maid, a
country girl, rapped loudly upon his door, crying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Geoffrey! The house has been broken into!
Your wireless room is all in disorder!&#8221;</p>

<p>Falconer sprang up, slipped on his dressing-gown,
and dashed down.</p>

<p>The room was turned upside down. The window
had been forced and was open, so that whoever entered
had had easy access to the place. No second glance
was needed to show that whoever had entered had been
there for one purpose only&mdash;in order to possess himself
of the secret of the improved amplifier!</p>

<p>A number of wires had been disconnected, while on
the table lay a piece of that paper ruled in small squares
and used by engineers to draw diagrams.</p>

<p>A diagram of the circuit had apparently been made,
but as the instruments were still intact, Falconer was
relieved to think that whoever had been prying about
had been disturbed before he had had time to discover
his secret.</p>

<p>Upon the floor lay the telephone, discarded; the
aerial switch had been left down just as the intruder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
had listened, and several connections had been pulled
away from the terminal screws.</p>

<p>The person who had done it was, no doubt, some one
skilled in wireless. That was apparent by the changing
over of one or two connections which only the eye of
an expert would detect. That the intruder had been
there through the hours of the night, and had gone
deliberately into everything aided by his own expert
knowledge was apparent.</p>

<p>But Geoffrey smiled within himself. He knew
that any intruder could not gain full knowledge of his
device unless he had taken that small box which was
attached to the amplifier. Whoever had been there
had been prying about&mdash;but had been foiled!</p>

<p>He closed the window that had been forced open,
and then set about replacing the wires which had been
disconnected, making up the circuit to its original
design.</p>

<p>The Professor, who had been told that burglars
had been in, entered the room excitedly, but Geoffrey
reassured him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody has been pottering about here. Lots
of people know of my device, and I suppose somebody
is out to try to discover it. But they haven&#8217;t done so.
They&#8217;ve made a horrible mess of things, but they don&#8217;t
know the whole truth, because they haven&#8217;t examined
the new saturation device. If they had taken that
away they would have found out everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very fortunate, Geoff!&#8221; exclaimed the old Professor.
&#8220;Most fortunate! Evidently some person wants to
filch your invention from you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. But they don&#8217;t seem to have done
it&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; And the young man crossed
eagerly to a big cupboard in the room, the door of
which stood unlocked.</p>

<p>From it he withdrew a small, green-enamelled, steel
dispatch-box.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Heavens!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got it!&#8221;
And his father saw that the box had been ripped open.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kept the diagram and specification of the windings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in there!&#8221; Geoffrey cried in dismay. &#8220;And they
have taken it. They know everything&mdash;and it is
not patented!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But who are the thieves?&#8221; queried the old man.
&#8220;Who could come here into this house, and deliberately
steal your invention?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! There are hundreds of unscrupulous persons
who have heard of it. They know how much it would
be worth to the world in the near future, and I can
only suppose that some plot has been formed to secure
it. And they&#8217;ve been successful! They have abstracted
the diagram from that box which I believed to be
practically thief-proof. It had a complicated lock,
but they have opened it with steel cutters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So the thieves know your secret, Geoff&mdash;the secret
which you have been so long perfecting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they do,&#8221; replied the young engineer, setting
his jaws firmly. &#8220;They have outwitted me! And
instead of being a rich man, as I had anticipated, I
am just where I was! I did my best to secure to the
world a better mode of amplification of wireless signals,
but they have stolen my invention. <i>Stolen it!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>And he stared wildly at his father as a man desperate.</p>

<p>An hour later Geoffrey was in the office of the Chief
Constable of Essex, and there related to him the whole
circumstances. Two detectives went over to Warley
in a car, and examined the premises. That entry
had been made in a very ingenious manner was quite
clear, and it was equally clear that the object was
solely to get sight of the improved amplifier, and to
secure the diagrams and specifications for which Geoffrey
was about to apply for patent rights.</p>

<p>There was no clue to the thief, but whoever it was
certainly knew something of wireless. No ordinary
burglar had committed the theft.</p>

<p>The examination of the room by the police took
place at about eleven o&#8217;clock, but at five that evening
a sensational discovery was made by a farm labourer
near Ardleigh Green, about two miles away on the
Romford Road. The man was on his way home from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
work when, crossing a field near the high road, he came
across the body of a well-dressed man.</p>

<p>He was startled to find that he was dead&mdash;having
been shot in the chest.</p>

<p>At once he informed the Romford police by telephone,
and they, on examining the body, declared it to be a
case of murder.</p>

<p>Late that night, after Falconer had returned from
Chelmsford, he received a visit from a police inspector
from Romford, who produced some documents.</p>

<p>&#8220;These,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we found on the body of the
stranger who was apparently murdered last night.
They appear to us to be wireless diagrams, and we wonder
if they may, by any chance, be yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey seized them eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;Why they&#8217;re mine&mdash;the
stolen plans of my invention!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it seems as though the thief, after committing
the robbery, was murdered,&#8221; the inspector
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it appears. But who can he be&mdash;and who
killed him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got to find out, sir. Perhaps
you&#8217;ll come into Romford with me and view the body?
You may know the man. He seems well-dressed,
and we found on him about forty pounds in Treasury
notes and several letters. But none of the latter give
any clue as to who he may be. The envelopes have
all been destroyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour later Geoffrey Falconer was shown the body
as it lay, pale and still, awaiting the coroner&#8217;s inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I recognise him!&#8221; gasped the young engineer
the moment his eyes fell upon the dead man&#8217;s face.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a man with whom I chatted at the Queen&#8217;s
Hotel, at Hastings, some weeks ago. I remember his
face quite well. And his hand. He is still wearing
that flesh-coloured calico glove!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was he alone?&#8221; asked the police inspector.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, as far as I know,&#8221; Geoffrey replied, and then
in a flash it occurred to him how the stranger, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
dead, had managed to strike up a conversation by
the overturning of the coffee. He recollected, too,
Sylvia&#8217;s instinctive dislike of the fellow.</p>

<p>But if the mysterious man had evil intentions, why
should he have taken all those pains to meet him?</p>

<p>In any case he had the satisfaction of having regained
possession of his precious diagram which in the night
had been filched from his dispatch-box.</p>

<p>He was shown the Treasury notes found in the dead
man&#8217;s wallet, and also the letters&mdash;four of them&mdash;all
in a woman&#8217;s hand. They were in French, dated simply
from Marlotte, a little village on the edge of the Forest
of Fontainebleau, cold, purely formal letters, but
signed &#8220;Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey Falconer knew that signature! He
possessed letters in the same handwriting. The
writer was the pretty decoy of thieves, the girl who
was now in love with his brother-officer, Hugh Carew.</p>

<p>The whole situation became intensely puzzling.
The man, whoever he was, had evidently stolen the
diagrams, but on making his way to Romford station
had been waylaid and shot by an unknown hand.
That was the theory held by Geoffrey, and also by the
police. The motive of the theft was, no doubt, in
order to sell the invention abroad to some rival radio
company in Germany, or in America, for new wireless
devices have always a ready market to the rich corporations
who&mdash;after the Marconi Company&mdash;attempt
to control the world&#8217;s communications through space.</p>

<p>Very naturally Geoffrey did his level best to keep
out of the papers what really had been stolen from his
father&#8217;s house. There were several interests at stake.
Hence, in the newspapers, the world read that the thief
had abstracted certain &#8220;papers&#8221; from the Professor&#8217;s
house, and these were found upon the dead man by
the police, and returned to their owner.</p>

<p>Those who read these lines will, no doubt, recollect
having read a bald and very unconvincing report of
the affair. They certainly never dreamed of the drama
and romance which lay behind it all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>At the inquest Geoffrey Falconer, who was called
to identify his &#8220;property,&#8221; and tell the court of his
meeting with the deceased at Hastings, was very guarded
in his evidence. He, of course, said nothing of the
pretty young girl whom he had met in Paris as an
Italian, and who was now in London under another
name and posing as French. The letters signed
&#8220;Gabrielle&#8221; were shown to the jury, but to them
they conveyed nothing. The twelve worthy tradesmen
of Romford had no suspicion whatever that &#8220;Gabrielle&#8221;
was a decoy of a clever thief, the man into the circumstances
of whose death they were called upon to inquire.</p>

<p>Who had killed the thief there was no evidence
whatever to show. As far as Geoffrey was concerned
he had little interest in the matter. The man had
taken a great risk, but had failed to dispose of the
diagrams, and thus filch from him a very considerable
sum. That the stranger&#8217;s death was due to vengeance
seemed quite feasible, and the jury could only arrive at
one conclusion in face of the fact that no weapon had
been found near the spot&mdash;namely, that wilful murder
had been &#8220;committed by some person or persons
unknown.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next day the diagrams of the improved amplifier
were placed in the bank, and the body of the deceased
was buried at the expense of the county of Essex.</p>

<p>The affair, however, filled Geoffrey&#8217;s mind mainly
because of the pretty Gabrielle&#8217;s association with his
friend Carew.</p>

<p>Though he remained silent, the suggestion occurred
to him about ten days afterwards to go to London
and meet Carew.</p>

<p>On calling at the club he found Hugh in the smoking-room,
and at once it became apparent that his appearance
was the reverse of welcome.</p>

<p>Carew seemed highly nervous and perturbed. They
sat over their cigarettes for half an hour chatting over
trivialities, when Geoffrey suddenly remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you read in the papers what a lot of
trouble I&#8217;ve had&mdash;a robbery at our house?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; his friend replied. &#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ve got an appointment
out in South Africa, Geoffrey, but&mdash;but before
I go I want to tell you something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come upstairs to the private room,&#8221; said Carew,
and both ascended the great old staircase, and passing
along a corridor, entered a small rather ill-lit room
where private conversation between members could
be indulged in.</p>

<p>When Hugh Carew had closed the door, he faced
his friend, and said in a low, tremulous voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;An explanation is due to you, Geoffrey. I know
that you must have been much mystified over the
occurrence at Warley, and the narrow escape you
had of your invention passing into the hands of
foreigners. I confess that I prevented it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You! How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I discovered that Gabrielle was held beneath
the thrall of that blackguard, Edward Everard, a thief
of the most unscrupulous type where women were
concerned. The girl confessed to me. She told me
how she had been compelled to aid him in his plans
in Paris and elsewhere, and how Everard was plotting
to obtain the secret of your wireless invention in order
to dispose of it to some people in Brussels. I induced
her to tell me the whole plot&mdash;a most ingenious one&mdash;and
then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And he paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, go on,&#8221; said Geoffrey, looking into the other&#8217;s
pale, hard-drawn face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;I followed him on that night,&#8221; he said in a
low, intense voice. &#8220;I watched him break into your
room and cut open the dispatch-box. I saw him
leave and go along the road, and&mdash;and in order to save
Gabrielle from him and save your invention from falling
into the hands of others, I&mdash;<i>I shot him</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did?&#8221; gasped Falconer, astounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And now you can give me up to the police.
I don&#8217;t care. I love Gabrielle, and I have saved her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
from that fiend who wore a glove to conceal a deformity
by which he could have been easily identified.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Gabrielle now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She sailed for Cape Town last Tuesday, and will
await me there. We arranged to be married on my
arrival.&#8221;</p>

<p>Falconer paused. A long silence fell between the
two men.</p>

<p>At last Geoffrey spoke, his voice trembling with
emotion:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and meet her in Cape Town, Hugh. I shall
regard your confession as sacred. You saved the
girl from further dishonour, and you saved to me the
fruits of my labours. It was murder, I admit. But
now that I know the dead man&#8217;s name, I am aware
that he was guilty of the same crime&mdash;the robbery
and murder of a wealthy old lady near Marseilles two
years ago&mdash;a woman to whom he had forced Gabrielle
to act as maid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will say nothing&mdash;not a word will pass
your lips?&#8221; asked Hugh Carew eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a word&mdash;I swear! The man has met with
his just deserts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Geoffrey,&#8221; was the other&#8217;s reply,
and both left the dull, half-dark room without further
word.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE DEVIL&#8217;S OVEN</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> calm summer morning broke gloriously over the
entrance to the English Channel between Land&#8217;s End
and the Lizard. The sea was blue, with only a faint
ripple.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beverley had been induced by Geoffrey to leave
Upper Brook Street to spend a few weeks in Cornwall,
taking Sylvia with her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>Indeed, it was Sylvia who pressed her mother to
go to Cornwall because Geoffrey was compelled to go
down to the Marconi wireless station at Poldhu, near
Mullion, where some alterations were being carried
out.</p>

<p>The widow and her daughter had, three days before,
taken up their quarters at the Poldhu Hotel, which
is situated high upon the cliff within a stone&#8217;s throw of
the high-power wireless station, which, at stated times
by day and by night, transmits messages to ships across
the Atlantic. Geoffrey had also taken up his quarters
there, and from the hotel windows a wide and beautiful
view could be obtained of the rugged Cornish coast,
the picturesque Poldhu Cove and the wild Halzaphron
Cliff standing out to sea, a rough granite headland.</p>

<p>Being summer, the hotel was full. The crowd was
of a refined class the blatant profiteer with his
bejewelled wife being happily absent. In the grounds
of the hotel was a path which led to a small gate whereon
was a notice&mdash;&#8220;Private. No Admittance&#8221;&mdash;the
entrance to the wireless station. Beyond that gate
no person was allowed to go, save by special authority
from the head office at Marconi House, though most
of the summer visitors longed to pass beyond and
learn the secrets of that wonderful station&mdash;the first
that Senatore Marconi established for communication
with America.</p>

<p>Geoffrey had breakfasted at seven, and had crossed
to the long, low-built buildings situate beneath those
high, spidery aerial wires, with their tall, slender masts
which withstand so well the fierce winter gales of the
Atlantic. There for over an hour he had been busy
making some adjustments upon the new eight-kilowatt
wireless telephone which was being set up for the
transmission of speech to Madrid. Then, at last,
he had emerged from the power-house and walked
along the gravelled path in the direction of the hotel,
for he knew that Sylvia, after breakfasting with her
mother, would be outside to enjoy the morning
sunshine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>He was not long before he caught sight of her, a
fresh, smiling figure in a summer blouse and cream
serge skirt. She wore no hat, and in her face showed
that health given by the sunshine and sea air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hulloa, Geoff!&#8221; she cried as she met the young
fellow. &#8220;Up and busy already?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;We&#8217;re still troubled over
the set. Can&#8217;t get it working properly yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on just now?&#8221; the girl asked, for
during the three days she had been there she had been
an unofficially privileged visitor to the wireless station
on account of her friendship with Falconer. She
had begun to know some of the routine of the traffic.</p>

<p>Her lover glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just twenty past nine,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;In ten
minutes they will be sending the Admiralty weather
forecast to the ships. Come over and watch it going
out,&#8221; he suggested, and, as she at once agreed, he turned
back with her.</p>

<p>Already, as they approached, they could hear the
dull roar of huge dynamos set in motion to test in
preparation for the powerful spark transmission, and
as they passed into the power-room, Geoffrey said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better hold your fingers in your ears when
they try the spark. Come, let&#8217;s have a look at the
Devil&#8217;s Oven.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he conducted her past a number of huge
condensers made of glass plates, and complicated
looking machinery, to a big chamber built of brick, like
a baker&#8217;s oven, through which all the messages passed
out.</p>

<p>The door was open, and inside she saw a big rotary
disc with copper points which the busy, bustling engineer
in charge was examining prior to its use.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is it called the &#8216;Devil&#8217;s Oven&#8217;?&#8221; asked
the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait&mdash;and you&#8217;ll see,&#8221; he laughed, introducing
her to the engineer, who was at work with his eye upon
the clock, for at all hazards each day the forecast has
to go out to time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>The pair stood together watching, until, a few
moments later, the engineer closed the door of the spark-chamber
and passed along to the great switch-board.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better hold your fingers in your ears,
Miss Beverley,&#8221; he said briskly, in passing. This she
did, and a second later when he pulled over the big
switch, a terrific noise was set up, almost enough to
break the drums of the unaccustomed ear. Then,
passing to a little room, the engineer rang a bell to the
transmission-room in a building a little distance away.</p>

<p>Next moment there came three short and one long
crashes in the Devil&#8217;s Oven&mdash;electric discharges which
showed blood-red through the square pane of glass
in the door, though they were really intensely blue,
while close by, upon a heavily insulated and protected
plate, two great blue sparks were being quenched by
a strong forced draught of air.</p>

<p>Again three short crashes followed by one long&mdash;the
letter &#8220;V,&#8221; the testing letter of the alphabet.</p>

<p>The engineer watched the spark, and at last, deciding
that it was efficient to reach to every ship across the
Atlantic and far north and south across land and sea
for three thousand miles, went again to the little room
and rang the bell to the operator signifying &#8220;O.K.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next moment the crashes in the Devil&#8217;s Oven became
continuous as across the ocean there was sent forth
the signal &#8220;C.Q.&#8221;&mdash;the general call for all to listen&mdash;followed
by the signal letters of Poldhu, &#8220;M.P.D.,&#8221; and
a message from the Admiralty telling captains of
ships what weather they might expect for the next
twenty-four hours, followed by a storm warning.</p>

<p>So deafening were the heavy discharges that the
girl was glad to get outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fancy!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Every ship at sea is listening
to the storm warning!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Let us go and see it being
sent by the key.&#8221;</p>

<p>They crossed to a small building which was divided
into two rooms. In one were the operators on the
land telegraph line to Marconi House, and in the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
sat the wireless operator, a smart-looking, dark-eyed
man with the telephones over his ears, tapping out
the message in silence, his chin resting upon his hand.
There only a slight clicking could be heard, the actual
discharge being effected by a relay.</p>

<p>He was repeating the message he had at first sent,
making, by dots and dashes, signals as set out by
the message written down upon a form before him which
had come over the land-wire from the Admiralty ten
minutes previously.</p>

<p>When he had finished, he rose and wished Sylvia
good-morning, for they had met on the previous day.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just off to bed, Miss Beverley,&#8221; he laughed.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been on duty all night, and we&#8217;ve had unusual
traffic with Madrid. First a lot of press, and then a
host of commercial messages. There&#8217;s some financial
trouble in Spain, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as the young man said this, Leonard Hamilton,
the engineer-in-charge, entered the room on his
morning inspection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Cator,&#8221; he asked, addressing the operator
after he had shaken hands with Sylvia, &#8220;has the forecast
gone out?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man replied in the affirmative, and then
handed the telephone to another man, rather slimmer
and fair-haired, who had just come on duty; at the
same time he signed the log-book, pointing to an entry
recording the fact that at seven forty-seven he had
called up Madrid on the continuous-wave set, and they
had not yet replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, the same old dodge!&#8221; declared Mr. Hamilton,
himself a youngish, good-looking man. &#8220;They pretend
they can&#8217;t get our &#8216;C.W.,&#8217; and always want us to send
on spark just because it is easier for them. They really
aren&#8217;t playing the game over there. Try them again
at ten, and every fifteen minutes afterwards. Is
there much to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eighteen messages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get them away soon, no doubt,&#8221; the chief
engineer said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve done the same old trick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
before. They bang over all their traffic in a bunch
to us, and then tell us to stand by for half an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They did that early this morning,&#8221; Cator said.
&#8220;They ended their transmission at four, and at once
told us to stand by till five. Fortunately we cleared
all our traffic to them then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hamilton, a most genial and delightful man, who
was loved by all the staff in that outlandish corner
of England, and who was one of the best known Marconi
engineers, smiled, and remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I know them, Cator&mdash;I know only too well!&#8221;</p>

<p>And he bent to glance at the log that had been kept
during the night.</p>

<p>When outside in the glorious morning sunshine,
Geoffrey turned to the pretty girl at his side as together
they walked back past the direction-finding building
along the path down to the hotel, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still puzzled over that affair I told you about
last night, dear. It&#8217;s most mysterious. I&#8217;m certain
that the man I met in the hall of the Polurrian Hotel
last night was the same man. I telephoned at eight
o&#8217;clock this morning, but they tell me that Mr. Martin&mdash;which
was the name he gave&mdash;has left. He had a
car to Gwinear Road station last night, and caught
the sleeper to Paddington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he knew that you had recognised him&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sincerely hope he doesn&#8217;t suspect that I recognised
him,&#8221; said Falconer. &#8220;But at any rate it is,
to say the least, strange that he should be down here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; the girl agreed. &#8220;Probably you&#8217;ll learn
something further about him soon.&#8221; Then she added:
&#8220;Mother wants you to come with us this afternoon
to Kynance Cove. She is asking Mr. and Mrs.
Hamilton and two other ladies from the hotel; we are
going to picnic there.&#8221;</p>

<p>He began to protest that he had work to do, but
later, when he consulted Hamilton, the pair decided
to finish early and join the ladies at half-past three.
This they did, and while Hamilton, brisk and burly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
drove his wife in his own grey car, Geoffrey, in a hired
car, accompanied Sylvia and her mother, and the two
other ladies with whom Mrs. Beverley was slightly
acquainted.</p>

<p>The drive was a beautiful one through one of the
wildest and remotest parts of Cornwall, over the
fresh breezy hills, through the old-world village of
Mullion, with its narrow, crooked streets, thence up
the hill to Penhale, and over the high-up straight road
which leads to Lizard Town. Before reaching the
town, however, they turned to the right just after
passing the Travellers&#8217; Rest, and presently found
themselves down in the Kynance Cove, one of the most
celebrated and most romantic spots on that rugged
granite coast.</p>

<p>They descended in the little bay beyond which rose
from the sea the Gull Rock and Asparagus Island,
with its cave known as the Devil&#8217;s Throat, and walked
upon the silvery sand beneath the high cliffs of beautifully
veined and coloured serpentine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly lovely!&#8221; declared Mrs. Beverley. &#8220;Just
to think that they issue a storm-warning on such a
glorious day!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Storms at sea often brew when the weather is
brightest&mdash;just as they do in our own lives, Mrs.
Beverley,&#8221; Geoffrey remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you&#8217;re always so horribly philosophical,&#8221;
laughed the American woman. &#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s your
profession that makes you so.&#8221; Together they had
mounted to the top of a grass-grown cliff, and with
their picnic basket, sat down to tea, which Mrs. Beverley
poured out from Thermos flasks.</p>

<p>From where the party sat there spread a magnificent
panorama of sea and rugged coast. Before them were
the two granite islands around which thousands of
gulls were swooping, while eastward lay the Venton
Hill and the many rocks around the Lizard&mdash;the most
southerly point in England&mdash;truly a wonderful scene,
so weird, rugged, and remote.</p>

<p>Presently, after tea, Sylvia, looking very sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in her summer gown, wandered away with the man she
loved, leaving Hamilton with the four ladies to stroll
and chatter. The pair took a rocky path which
ascended higher up the hill, and as they went along,
Mrs. Beverley shouted after them:</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, dear, we leave at six o&#8217;clock!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl smiled back, waved her hand, and then went
on with her companion.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mrs. Beverley was not altogether pleased
with the situation, for her secret intention had all
along been to marry Sylvia into the peerage. Had
she not come to London for that purpose? Yet, after
all, Geoffrey Falconer was a charming and highly-intelligent
young fellow, whose several discoveries in
wireless were, she had been told, likely to bring him
a considerable fortune in the future.</p>

<p>As the pair halted on the top of the hill, Sylvia
suddenly paused, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, Geoffrey, I can&#8217;t help thinking about
that strange man you saw in the Polurrian last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Somehow I, too, can&#8217;t forget
him. I first met him in the <i>wagon-restaurant</i> of the
express from Paris to Calais about three weeks ago.
He sat at the next table, and though he was reading
the <i>Matin</i> between the courses at lunch, I noticed that
he seemed to be watching me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not another Edward Everard, I hope,&#8221; said the
girl, whose hair was being blown across her face by
the sea breeze which was just springing up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; laughed her merry lover. &#8220;But
he seems to have followed me so persistently. Why
I cannot tell. Possibly he may have learnt my profession,
and of my post in the Marconi service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if he has, then, what motive has he for following
you? One thing is reassuring. Your secret diagrams
are now in a safe place. When did you see him again
after meeting him in the train?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the boat, crossing to Dover. Then I lost sight
of him, until one morning, when I arrived by train at
Chelmsford as usual, I saw him lounging downstairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in the booking-hall. At first I did not recognise him,
but after I had passed and was walking along that path
which is the short cut to the Works, I recollected the
incident on the Calais express. Then it all passed
from my mind again until I encountered him accidentally
in the lounge of the Polurrian. Why was he here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps to spend a week by the sea!&#8221; laughed
Sylvia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly that!&#8221; Falconer said. &#8220;He was down
here for some distinct purpose. And that purpose
I mean to discover. I intend to establish why he
came down here so near the Poldhu station and stayed
the night as Mr. Martin. Remember, only the other
day he was at Chelmsford, and now he had been to
Poldhu, and left hurriedly after seeing me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he never expected you were here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly my opinion. Probably my presence
has frightened him off. I only hope it has. Nevertheless
I don&#8217;t like the situation. Something is amiss
somewhere&mdash;and I intend to fathom it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man is not English, you told me. Why should
he go under the name of Martin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin is a name not unknown in France,&#8221; Falconer
remarked. &#8220;He may be French. Indeed, I recollect
when I first saw him in the train I put him down as
a Parisian.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Sylvia and her lover were much puzzled. It
certainly was annoying to be watched as Falconer
had evidently been.</p>

<p>That evening they drove back over the Cornish
hills with the sun setting away across the Atlantic.
But already the breeze was increasing. The storm
prophecy of early morning was being fulfilled.</p>

<p>Together they dined pleasantly in that long room
at the Poldhu Hotel which overlooks the pretty cove,
Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton dining with them. Afterwards
they all went across the wide grounds of the wireless
station to the Hamiltons&#8217; pretty bungalow, where they
spent the remainder of the evening.</p>

<p>Hamilton was a typical Marconi man, burly, easy-going,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and refined. An expert wireless engineer, he
had worked stations in India, South America, and
other places, and ran a secret station during the war&mdash;a
station which had to its credit the destroying of
many German submarines. With his charming, dark-haired,
cosmopolitan wife who that night was hostess
to the wealthy South American widow, he had lived in
all sorts of outlandish places in the shadow of wireless
aerials, ever on duty day and night with the alarm-bell
at his bedside in case of a breakdown.</p>

<p>Of wireless troubles he had many. Yet he was one
of those easy-going golfers whom nothing disturbed.
He was devoted to his wife; he led an ideal life in
his picturesque, roomy bungalow in that wild, windswept
spot overlooking the Atlantic, and he smoked
his pet pipe, and never allowed anything to upset him.
With all the public schoolboy spirit, he was devoted
to his duty, and though severe and just, was yet highly
popular with his whole staff.</p>

<p>In that bungalow the Hamiltons led a charming
existence, though, if judged by life in London, it might
be voted terribly dull. So it was in winter when there
were no summer visitors at the hotel. But even then
they had the society of the little colony of Marconi
men who lived in other bungalows and down in Mullion
or in Cury.</p>

<p>Sylvia was delighted with Mrs. Hamilton&#8217;s outspoken
cosmopolitanism. She had been in half-a-dozen
different lands with her husband, and her bungalow
life suited her, even though servants were, perhaps,
hard to keep in that remote spot. But her house was
well-ordered, and furnished with great taste, a fact
upon which Mrs. Beverley commented.</p>

<p>In the long drawing-room where the furnishings
showed souvenirs of travel far afield, the chief engineer
and Geoffrey smoked their cigarettes, while the ladies
gossiped. Presently the two men left and entered
the dining-room for a drink before parting. Then
Geoffrey, as they sat near the table together, told his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
colleague of the strange movements of the visitor to
the Polurrian Hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very funny!&#8221; agreed Hamilton, who at that
moment was lighting his beloved briar. &#8220;What can
he be doing down here? Of course, we have lots of
people trying to pry around the station. But I always
take a very firm hand. Nobody sees anything except
by signed order from the head office. It wouldn&#8217;t
do to take strangers into the transmitting room where
they could read any of the messages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; Geoffrey said. &#8220;But I intend
to follow up the fellow and see what his game is. I
don&#8217;t like being spied upon like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, try to solve the mystery,&#8221; replied the engineer-in-charge.</p>

<p>Next day Geoffrey was early astir. At six o&#8217;clock
he was already out and over at the wireless station,
making some tests upon the new gear, and at nine,
after a hurried breakfast at the hotel, he walked over
to the Polurrian, where, from the hall-porter, he learned
several facts. The visitor, Mr. Martin, had arrived
by the evening train from London, had dined, and had
gone out for about an hour on foot in the evening light&mdash;across
the cliffs in the direction of Pradanack, he
believed. Then he came back and went early to bed.
All next day he had lounged about the hotel, chatting
with several of the ladies. Just before dinner he had
suddenly ordered a car and told them at the office
to ring up the stationmaster at Penzance and secure
a sleeper to Paddington, and that he would join the
train at Gwinear Road.</p>

<p>Later in a hired car Geoffrey drove to the little town
of Helston, and took train to the terminus of that
winding branch-line which ends at Gwinear Road,
on the main line from Penzance to Paddington. From
the stationmaster there he learnt that Martin had
joined the night mail to Paddington. He also learnt
something further&mdash;namely, that he had despatched
a telegram to a person named Meyer at an address<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
in Hertford Road, Bayswater. The words were:
&#8220;Thursday at eleven.&#8221;</p>

<p>At once Geoffrey decided to return to London. Therefore,
he telephoned to Hamilton at Poldhu asking him
to tell Mrs. Beverley that he was called to town, and
promising to be back very soon.</p>

<p>An hour later he was in the slow train for Plymouth,
and that night, the night of Wednesday, he was back
in London.</p>

<p>At midnight he passed the house in Hertford Road,
Bayswater. It was in darkness, but was evidently
a place where apartments were let, quite a respectable
house of the usual Bayswater type.</p>

<p>He slept at the Great Western Hotel at Paddington,
without even a clean collar, be it said, and just before
eleven o&#8217;clock next day he stood looking idly into a
shop window in Westbourne Grove, at the corner of
Hertford Road, pretending not to be interested in any
passer-by.</p>

<p>At about a minute before eleven the mysterious
Mr. Martin, smartly-dressed and walking jauntily,
turned the corner behind Falconer, and passing up
Hertford Road, rang at the door of the house which
the young wireless engineer had examined on the
previous night.</p>

<p>In a few seconds the door was opened by a maid,
and Mr. Martin disappeared within.</p>

<p>A girl of about eighteen, who looked like a dressmaker
from one of the several establishments in &#8220;The
Grove,&#8221; was the only person in the road at the moment.
Geoffrey noticed her. She was rather poorly-dressed,
and seemed to be searching for some house, the description
of which she did not recognise.</p>

<p>Gaining the corner of Westbourne Grove, she was
met by a quietly-dressed, middle-aged man, to whom
she spoke a few words hurriedly. The man replied,
apparently telling her something. Then with a smile
they parted, the girl going in the direction of Queen&#8217;s
Road, and the man, who seemed to be an idler, calmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
filling his pipe and lighting it as he stood at the junction
of the two thoroughfares.</p>

<p>Geoffrey saw all this, but it did not strike him as
in any way peculiar. In London many men meet
girls at the corners of streets, speak a few words to them,
and then pass on. There was nothing really unusual
about the girl&#8217;s action.</p>

<p>Falconer&#8217;s chief concern at the moment was not
to be recognised by the man who had, no doubt, watched
him when coming over from Paris, where he had been
on business for his company&mdash;the man who had taken
alarm on seeing him down at Poldhu. For over an
hour carefully he watched the door of that house in
Hertford Road, taking every precaution that he was
not observed from the windows. If anything sinister
was in progress, then, no doubt, somebody would look
forth to see that all was clear and that there was no
watcher.</p>

<p>Half an hour after noon the door suddenly opened,
when the mysterious Martin emerged, and passing
out of the gate, turned back in the direction where
Falconer was watching.</p>

<p>Fortunately he drew back in time to escape recognition,
and to watch Martin enter a taxi and drive
away. Another taxi was near the kerb, therefore in
it he followed the foreigner away to North London,
to a small, rather dingy shop where electrical appliances
were sold&mdash;a shop well known to wireless experimenters
who are in search of odd and second-hand apparatus
and bargains of every description.</p>

<p>The man remained in the place for nearly half an
hour, but so blocked up was window and door that the
passer-by in Chalk Farm Road could not get a glimpse
within. The establishment was one of the most antique
in London, and patronised widely by amateurs as well
as the greatest scientists in that city.</p>

<p>Presently he came forth bearing a good-sized wooden
box, which he put on the front of the taxi, and then
drove to the Hotel Russell, where he entered and
dismissed the taxi.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>A judicious chat with the hall-porter revealed the
fact that the name under which the stranger was known
was Mr. Charles Lazarus. And he declared himself
as a French subject.</p>

<p>With this knowledge Geoffrey engaged a room at
the hotel and started to keep strict surveillance upon
the stranger. The man&#8217;s movements were most
mysterious. That same evening he met three other
men, palpably foreigners, at the Café Royal, where
they dined together expensively, and afterwards all
four drove in a taxi to a big double-fronted house in
Maresfield Gardens, Hampstead.</p>

<p>Some time after they had been inside, Geoffrey
managed to slip into the small front garden, and,
approaching stealthily one of the lower bay windows,
listened. He distinguished men&#8217;s voices, though he
could not hear what words were being uttered. He
thought they were speaking in French.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a sharp metallic clicking.
Instantly he recognised it as the tick of a Morse telegraph
&#8220;sounder.&#8221; The letters of the alphabet were being
sent both rapidly and well. There was no message&mdash;merely
the letters A to Z, followed quickly by the
numbers 0 to 9. They were evidently testing some
apparatus.</p>

<p>He looked about to see any telegraph wires around
the house, but the night was too dark and overcast
to enable him to distinguish anything.</p>

<p>What was happening within, he wondered? The
sound was certainly that of either a post-office telegraph
transmitter or receiving &#8220;inker.&#8221; The click was
too familiar and too pronounced for him to be
mistaken.</p>

<p>Fearing discovery he withdrew, and then he waited
in a dark doorway for the reappearance of the man
upon whom he was keeping observation. Martin
came out very soon after eleven o&#8217;clock, and walking
down to Swiss Cottage station, took train, and made
his way back to the hotel.</p>

<p>Falconer became more than ever puzzled. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
was the connection between this Frenchman&#8217;s visit
to Poldhu and the tapping of that Morse key? Of
some sinister plot he felt convinced. Why should
the stranger have watched him so closely in the train
to Calais, and then flown on being recognised at the
Polurrian Hotel?</p>

<p>Next morning after breakfast he went to the hall-porter
of the Hotel Russell, and casually inquired
whether he had seen Mr. Lazarus.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gentleman left at seven-thirty, sir,&#8221; was the
man&#8217;s prompt reply. &#8220;I put his luggage on a taxi,
and I heard him tell the man to drive to Paddington.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paddington! Had the man of mystery returned
to Cornwall? That was Falconer&#8217;s thought.</p>

<p>Quickly he drove in a taxi to Paddington, where he
ascertained from the booking-clerk that four first-class
return tickets had been issued to Truro that morning.
He described the man Martin as the person who had
paid for them. Eager not to lose sight of the four
foreigners, Falconer hurried to Marconi House, and
was soon on the private land-telegraph line which connects
the head office with the wireless station at remote
Poldhu&mdash;the line over which all the messages are sent
to and from London.</p>

<p>Seated at the telegraph-key, Falconer was soon
talking by Morse to one of the assistant-engineers
named Benfield, Mr. Hamilton having gone into
Helston to see after the delivery of some overdue
machinery which had been sent from the works at
Chelmsford.</p>

<p>To Benfield he described Martin and his companions,
and asked him to motor over to Truro, meet them on
arrival, and watch where they went. He added that
he should take the next train down to Truro, where
he would, on arrival, meet Benfield at the Red Lion.
He also sent a message through Benfield to Sylvia
telling her of his movements.</p>

<p>At noon he was in the express due to reach Truro
three hours after the arrival of the mysterious four.
At seven o&#8217;clock that evening he entered the old-world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Red Lion Hotel, and found Benfield awaiting
him with disappointing news.</p>

<p>No men answering the description of the four foreigners
had arrived at Truro by the London express which had
left Paddington at ten-thirty and had previously
arrived.</p>

<p>Geoffrey was nonplussed. His plans had gone
entirely wrong! That some mischief was intended
he felt assured. His intuition told him that Martin
and his companions should be watched, but evidently
they had very cleverly evaded pursuit.</p>

<p>They might have purposely broken their journey
at Exeter or at Plymouth. Therefore, he met three
other possible trains from London, yet each time he
was doomed to disappointment. That they had taken
tickets to Truro was no evidence that they intended to
alight there. They might have got out at some wayside
station.</p>

<p>So after the arrival of the half-past ten train that
night there was nothing to do but hire a car, and, accompanied
by Benfield, he returned to Poldhu, arriving
there half an hour after midnight.</p>

<p>The wireless station was brilliantly lit. The great
generators were going, ready for the commencement
of the night&#8217;s heavy traffic, for real work commences
there at one o&#8217;clock in the morning, because, as all
wireless men know, daylight interferes with the
strength of wireless signals, so most of the cross-Atlantic
traffic and that to distant ships is carried on from that
remote corner of England between nightfall and dawn.</p>

<p>Falconer, after a chat with Hamilton, went back
to the hotel, where he slept till six, and then, after
an early breakfast, drove by car back to the Red Lion
at Truro. For three days he remained there, eagerly
watching the arrival of every train, but he saw nothing
of the men who had so cleverly evaded his watchfulness.
It now became quite evident that Truro was
not the real destination of Martin and his companions.</p>

<p>On the fourth day, however, at sundown, as he was
passing out of the smoking-room of the old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
hotel through the lounge into the busy street, it being
market day, he chanced to glance to the left at the
crowd of farmers standing at the public bar, when
suddenly he caught sight of a man whom he instantly
recognised as having been one of Martin&#8217;s companions
at the Café Royal. In broken English the man was
inquiring of the barmaid the way to Tregoney, and
she was telling him that it was about six miles out
on the Plymouth road, and that he could get a taxi
at the garage opposite the hotel.</p>

<p>Falconer held his breath, and paused.</p>

<p>It was evident that the stranger had only just arrived
in Truro. Tregoney&mdash;the young man recollected the
name. Ten minutes later he learnt that the place
was a small village on the main road to Plymouth,
between Truro and St. Austell. So he allowed the
foreigner to go, and waited in impatience till night
fell, when he hired a car, and, with a little flash-lamp
in his pocket, drove to the outskirts of the remote
village. There he ordered the taxi-driver to wait for
an hour, and then went on to seek what information
he could.</p>

<p>Halfway along the village street, where lights showed
in the windows of most of the cottages, he came to a
small inn, which he entered and ordered some cold
beef and a bottle of beer. Landlords of inns are proverbially
talkative to their good customers, and from
the burly Cornish host Geoffrey, as he ate his meal,
was not long in ascertaining that a strange foreign
gentleman, whose description tallied exactly with Martin,
had taken a large house at the farther end of &#8220;the
town.&#8221; He was a stranger who had come over to
England for his health, and he had rented the place
furnished from old Miss Trethowen, who had gone to
live in London for six months.</p>

<p>The foreign gentleman had only arrived three days
before, and as far as the landlord knew had not yet
engaged any servants, except a deaf old woman named
Grey, who had acted as Miss Trethowen&#8217;s caretaker.
Nobody in the village had ever seen the foreign gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
before. He had arrived with a companion, a
tall, thin-faced young man, and they had but little
luggage except two large wooden boxes.</p>

<p>Having ascertained these facts, Geoffrey finished
his meal and walked along the high road until he came
to a large, old-fashioned house, standing back in the
darkness from the road, along which ran many telegraph
wires. A carriage-drive led up to the place, which
seemed very lonely and neglected.</p>

<p>In a window of the first floor there showed a light.
Geoffrey, treading softly, entered the gate and silently
crossed the rough grass towards the house. Scarcely
had he reached the short flight of steps before the front
door, being very cautious because a house dog might
be about, when he heard a familiar click-click-clickety-click&mdash;the
noise of a Morse &#8220;sounder.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was again the same sound he had heard in Hampstead.
Why? Had they, he wondered, been testing
some instruments there&mdash;instruments bought of the
dealer in Chalk Farm Road?</p>

<p>In the darkness he strained his ears. What he read
by those dots and dashes amazed him. He stood
aghast for a few moments.</p>

<p>Then, having listened intently to make quite certain
that his discovery was an absolute fact, he stole quietly
away, and walking back through the village, re-entered
the taxi and drove back over to Poldhu.</p>

<p>His suspicions had been confirmed! Though it
was very late when he arrived, he found Hamilton in
his pretty bungalow, and told him of his strange
discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll take every precaution in secret, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221; urged Falconer. &#8220;Nobody must know of
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trust me,&#8221; replied the engineer-in-charge, at
once eager and ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve only to wait and be very watchful. There&#8217;s
some clever game afoot, without a doubt,&#8221; Falconer
said, and presently he went along the path to the hotel,
and to bed, while Hamilton, even at that late hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
crossed to the transmission room for a final look round
before retiring.</p>

<p>Next day Geoffrey, who confided his suspicions to
Sylvia, became very active. Several hours he spent
in the transmission room, where Cator, with the
&#8220;Brown receivers&#8221; over his head, was very busy transmitting
and receiving acknowledgments. Falconer
was watching every message, and also spent much of
his time in the adjoining room, where the land-line
from Marconi House was constantly working.</p>

<p>A dozen times that morning he was in close consultation
with Hamilton. Then, at about five o&#8217;clock
in the afternoon, both drove in Hamilton&#8217;s car into
Truro.</p>

<p>Till about half-past nine they waited at the hotel,
when they drove out to Tregoney, and, leaving the car
at the little inn, they both walked along to the village
post-office, where, even though so late, they saw the
postmaster and explained that they were awaiting
an urgent telephone message from the wireless station
at Poldhu. Hamilton having made himself known,
the postmaster at once agreed to send along to the inn&mdash;only
a few yards distant&mdash;and call them when they
were wanted.</p>

<p>Then the pair returned to the inn and ordered
supper. Scarcely were they halfway through it when
the postmaster himself hurried in and announced that
Poldhu was on the line.</p>

<p>Hamilton rose instantly and dashed out. Five
minutes later he returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; he said breathlessly. &#8220;It&#8217;s just what
you expected, Falconer. Henway, the chief constable
of Truro, and four of his men are awaiting us just
down the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>Together the pair went out into the darkness, and
at the end of the village the chief constable came out
from the shadows to join them. After a few words
from Hamilton, the police official whistled softly, and
from nowhere, apparently, four of his assistants
appeared.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>Then whispering softly all went along to Miss
Trethowen&#8217;s house, and slipping one after the other
into the garden, they surrounded it. This effected,
Henway rang boldly at the door, but received no answer.
There was no sign of the clicking of the Morse instrument.
All was quiet. Thrice he rang, when at last
the bolts were drawn, and the thin man, whom Falconer
had seen in the Red Lion in Truro, cautiously opened
the door.</p>

<p>Next second the police rushed in. Henway and
Falconer were first inside, and turning into a room
on the left of the hall, which was Miss Trethowen&#8217;s
dining-room, they saw upon the table a most up-to-date
Morse telegraph instrument with wires attached to it
trailing along the red Turkey carpet and out of the
window.</p>

<p>The commotion caused by the entry of the police
was great. All four occupants of the house were
utterly staggered when Henway ordered their arrest
on a charge of tapping telegraph wires, the property
of the Postmaster-General, and with the interference
of the secrecy of messages.</p>

<p>The man Martin instantly showed fight, firing three
revolver shots point-blank at Falconer, none of which,
very fortunately, took effect. The fellow was, however,
quickly overpowered, and all four were later on conveyed
to Truro police-station and placed in the cells.</p>

<p>To cut short this narrative of the romance of wireless,
it is sufficient to explain that, as was afterwards discovered,
the man who called himself Martin was an
expert French bank thief, who had committed many
great swindles both in Europe and America. In this
particular case he had succeeded in obtaining, under
threats of blackmail from a hard-up bank-clerk in
Madrid, a copy of the secret code used by the London
office of the Estremadura Bank&mdash;a great Spanish
banking corporation&mdash;when ordering telegraphic payments
to be made from the head office in Madrid.</p>

<p>With his three associates, one of whom was an ex-telegraphist
of the post-office at Aranjuez, near Madrid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Martin had come to England, having purposely followed
Falconer from Paris, knowing him by repute as a
Marconi engineer.</p>

<p>His movements had at first been closely followed,
for the Metropolitan police had been warned of Martin&#8217;s
arrival, and he had been shadowed to Hertford Road
by a girl in the employ of Scotland Yard. But afterwards,
so honest did the man appear, that the surveillance
had been dropped, and it had remained to Geoffrey
to investigate the plot.</p>

<p>Martin had, as it was afterwards proved, bought
in Chalk Farm Road certain component parts of a very
sensitive and up-to-date appliance for tapping the land-line
from London to Poldhu, which runs from Plymouth
to St. Austell, and past Miss Trethowen&#8217;s house to
Truro and Poldhu.</p>

<p>By tapping the trunk telegraph wire that night
Martin had been able, by a very ingenious arrangement
which Falconer afterwards examined, to despatch an
urgent message to Poldhu just as though it had been
received over the counter in the office in Fenchurch
Street, in London, and tapped out from Marconi House.
Thus the conspirators had been able to interpose a
false message which they intended should be sent by
wireless from Poldhu to Madrid.</p>

<p>The whole plot was extremely cleverly conceived,
for on that night, just before Hamilton rang up Poldhu,
they had sent instructions in code presumably from
the London office in Lombard Street to the head office
in Madrid ordering the bank to pay to a certain Señor
Alfonso Fonesca, living in the Calle Zorilla, in Madrid,
the sum of thirteen thousand five hundred and eighty
pounds sterling at the current rate of exchange.</p>

<p>Needless to record, the false message which had
been so cleverly imposed upon the land-wire was never
dispatched from Poldhu, for that night all messages
had been suspect, and the one in question was held
back.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, Martin&mdash;who at the Court
Assizes at Bodmin was proved to be a Swiss subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>&mdash;is
serving a term of seven years&#8217; penal servitude, as
well as his three companions, all of whom were Belgians.</p>

<p>Happily the bogus message they sent from Tregoney
did not, as they hoped, pass through the &#8220;Devil&#8217;s
Oven&#8221; and out into Space. So the bank was saved
a theft of nearly fourteen thousand pounds.</p>

<small>THE MYSTERY WIDOW</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t</span> it a horrid nuisance, Geoffrey, Lord Hendlewycke
has arrived!&#8221; exclaimed Sylvia Beverley as she stood
with her lover on the terrace before the luxurious
Hôtel Royal, at Dinard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hendlewycke here!&#8221; exclaimed the young Marconi
engineer in surprise. &#8220;Then I suppose it means that
I&#8217;d better get back to London,&#8221; he said rather grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it too bad of mother? She&#8217;s just told me
that she wrote to the fellow asking him to join us on
our motor trip to Touraine,&#8221; the pretty, dark-haired
girl said petulantly. &#8220;I shall decline to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you know the reason, dearest, just as I do,&#8221;
said Falconer. &#8220;Your mother disapproves of us
being so much together, and intends that you shall
become Lady Hendlewycke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I obey mother in all things&mdash;but I won&#8217;t marry
Hendlewycke,&#8221; declared the girl decisively. &#8220;Of
course he&#8217;s awfully useful to us socially. Through
him we&#8217;ve got to know some of the very best people
in London. Mother likes all that sort of thing, but
personally he bores me.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Mrs. Beverley&#8217;s stay at Poldhu she had taken
Sylvia on a motor tour. They had landed at Boulogne
from Folkestone, and had had a beautiful run to Dinard,
where Geoffrey, with three weeks&#8217; leave due to him,
had joined them a few days before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>Both mother and daughter were delighted with
Dinard. It is a place which in summer appeals to
the wealthy, with its luxurious hotels and gay casino,
its smart world of bathing and dancing, and its expensive
shops, most of them branches of the best establishments
in Paris. There, in the Casino, on the <i>plage</i>
or in the hotels, the <i>haut-monde</i> loves to rub shoulders
with the <i>demi-monde</i>, and in these days it is, <i>par excellence</i>,
the resort of the blatant war-profiteer and his
fat, uncouth wife.</p>

<p>It was noon. The gay, cosmopolitan idlers of both
sexes were either bathing or taking their <i>apératif</i>,
or else wandering about the scrupulously clean streets
and inspecting the shops.</p>

<p>Sylvia, in her cream summer gown and large hat,
presented a delightful figure as, at her lover&#8217;s side, she
wandered presently along the Rue du Casino, in order
to buy some flowers for the table of their private sitting-room
at the hotel.</p>

<p>The weather was glorious. It was warmer on what
the French term the Emerald Coast than it had been
in Cornwall, while the life and society was, indeed, a
change from the rural quietude of Poldhu Cove.</p>

<p>Just as the pair were passing the entrance to the
Casino, a stout, middle-aged, very smartly-dressed
woman halted and spoke to Sylvia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Madame Claudet!&#8221; the girl cried. &#8220;Why&mdash;how
long have you been over in Europe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About four months,&#8221; she replied, speaking broken
English with a strong French accent. &#8220;My husband
died, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; exclaimed Sylvia. &#8220;Mr. Claudet dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>And for the first time she noticed that the lady was
in mourning.</p>

<p>&#8220;He died of heart failure, suddenly&mdash;in the street
in New York,&#8221; the rather handsome widow said. Then
when Sylvia had expressed her condolence, she turned
and introduced Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m at the Hôtel des Terrasses,&#8221; Madame Claudet
said to the girl. &#8220;Where are you staying?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>Sylvia told her, and begged her to call upon her
mother that afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall be so very delighted to see you again,&#8221; she
added. &#8220;Mother has often spoken of you, and recalled
our gay days together at Palm Beach.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame promised to call, and then, when Sylvia
and Geoffrey walked on, the girl said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Madame Claudet! I&#8217;m so sorry! Her
husband was a very wealthy man. They had a lot
of valuable property, I believe, in Brazil. We
knew her in Florida. I&#8217;m so glad we&#8217;ve come across
her. I shall ask mother to invite her to go with us
to Touraine.&#8221;</p>

<p>At luncheon Geoffrey met Lord Hendlewycke, whom,
of course, he had known in London. All the men
who went up and down St. James&#8217;s Street knew
Hendlewycke as a very hard-up peer, who was glad
to get dinners and luncheons at other people&#8217;s expense.
How he lived nobody exactly knew, for he was believed
not to possess the proverbial &#8220;bean.&#8221; Yet he was
a bright optimist, with a fund of amusing anecdotes,
and very popular with hostesses of all sorts.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the French widow called upon
Mrs. Beverley, and was received with great enthusiasm.
At tea Geoffrey met her again, and afterwards agreed
with Sylvia that she was a most charming person.
She had been born in the Alpes Maritimes, but had been
taken to America by her parents when she was about
eighteen, and had married a Mr. Claudet, an American,
whose father had been French. Hence she possessed
all the natural <i>chic</i> of the Frenchwoman, combined with
the go-ahead characteristics of the American.</p>

<p>Next day, notwithstanding Sylvia&#8217;s appeal, Geoffrey
left Dinard for London in response to a telegram he
pretended had come from Marconi House. Mrs.
Beverley, at heart, did not regret his departure, because
she hoped that during the motor tour through the
Côtes du Nord, Morbihan, and the Maine-et-Loire,
which she had arranged, his lordship might propose
to Sylvia.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>Back again at the Marconi Works at Chelmsford,
Geoffrey became immersed in his patient research
into further wonders of wireless. He was engaged
with others upon a new idea.</p>

<p>One day he had occasion to go from Chelmsford
over to Witham, where there had just been established
the new wireless station in direct communication with
Paris. Witham is nine miles from Chelmsford, and,
although messages from France are received upon the
aerial wires there, the transmission is effected from the
great aerial at the Chelmsford Works.</p>

<p>On that particular morning he had been in the
transmission room at Chelmsford, watching the huge
panel with its big array of great illuminated globes&mdash;the
transmission-valves for continuous waves&mdash;and
chatting with Mr. Drew, the shrewd, dark-haired
engineer in grey tweeds, who was, perhaps, the world&#8217;s
greatest expert in wireless telephony. In the big hall,
full of wonderful apparatus and huge condensers&mdash;the
result of many scientific brains&mdash;the pair had been
watching the relay work, the rapid dots and dashes
from the key at Witham, and then, in consultation,
they had agreed upon a still further diagram that might
perhaps give better results.</p>

<p>In consequence, Falconer had gone over to Witham,
leaving the ever-watchful Mr. Drew with his powerful
transmission-set, with which he had a short time
before spoken across the Atlantic, and to Senatore
Marconi while on board his yacht in the Mediterranean&mdash;the
set which he regarded with as much tenderness
as though it were his own child&mdash;as, indeed, it really
was.</p>

<p>That wonderful display of apparatus was but the
germ of a revolution in the transmission of speech.
It was purely experimental, and was now being used,
not for long-distance telephony, but for the exchange
of Morse signals with Paris&mdash;sent automatically at
such a speed as to be unreadable by any listener.</p>

<p>The inner room was a hive of industry. Upon the
operating bench was a &#8220;siphon recorder&#8221;&mdash;a delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
instrument which was actually writing, by means of
a kind of fountain pen, upon the paper &#8220;tape&#8221; the
dots and dashes sent automatically at a speed of one
hundred words a minute. The pen never left the
paper, but rose up and down, making short or long
strokes in violet ink on the upper side of the paper,
and was one of the latest marvels of delicate wireless
instruments.</p>

<p>Geoffrey glanced at it casually. It clicked on
continuously night and day in response to the automatic
hand of the transmitter in Paris tapping his key.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Frenchmen are keeping us very busy,&#8221; Graham
remarked. &#8220;Look! We&#8217;re overwhelmed, but up at
the Fenchurch Street office it must be worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey nodded For some seconds he watched
the &#8220;recorder&#8221; at work, and then presently he and
Graham sat down at the receiving set and began to
discuss where an improvement would possibly be made.
They were seated close to the &#8220;recorder,&#8221; when presently,
through mere force of habit, Geoffrey, even
while chatting with Graham, found himself reading
the incoming messages. Suddenly there became
recorded on the tape in that curious crooked writing
the words, &#8220;Marguerite Claudet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Claudet? In a moment he recollected that it
was the name of the wealthy widow to whom
Sylvia had introduced him in Dinard. He took the
tape, and reading back, found that the message, which
had been dispatched from Paris half an hour before,
was addressed to a person named Mildmay, apparently
living in chambers in Ryder Street, London, and that
it was in code&mdash;a jumble of figures and letters.</p>

<p>At first, the origin of the message being Paris, Geoffrey
merely smiled within himself at the similarity of the
name, and recollected the seal of secrecy regarding
all messages. But a few moments later, he recollected
that Mrs. Beverley had addressed her friend as &#8220;dear
Margot.&#8221; For aught he knew the lady was motoring
with Mrs. Beverley on their trip to the ancient châteaux
on the Loire.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>Before leaving Dinard, Sylvia had given him the
Hôtel de l&#8217;Univers, at Tours, as their central address
while in Touraine. At that time Madame Claudet,
though invited to join the motoring party, had not
decided whether to accept. In Falconer&#8217;s presence
she had declared that she would be compelled to go
to Paris to see her bankers upon some matter of business
from South America.</p>

<p>The message to Mildmay was evidently a private
prearranged jumble of figures and letters, the whole
perhaps meaning but one word, &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no.&#8221;
Such codes are by far the most difficult to decipher.</p>

<p>Next day, so interested did he become in the message
through space, which had, of course, been delivered
to the addressee, that he telegraphed to Sylvia at Tours
asking whether Madame Claudet was with them, but
begging that she should not be told of his inquiry.</p>

<p>The reply came in due course. Madame Claudet
had been on business to Paris, and had just rejoined
them at Tours. Naturally, Sylvia asked the reason
of his inquiry, to which he replied by wire that he would
tell her when next they met.</p>

<p>He had, however, established the fact that the rich
widow had been in Paris, and it certainly seemed as
if the message he had noticed upon the green recording
tape was really from her.</p>

<p>For the next few days he was extremely busy over
at Witham, assisting in getting the London-Paris
service going more smoothly. The most delicate
adjustment of the instruments is necessary in wireless
stations when at first fitted, for the apparatus is so
often liable to unaccountable freaks and interruptions,
each of which must be methodically overcome until
the service is brought to perfection.</p>

<p>The apparatus at Witham, having at last been tuned
up to the highest pitch, Geoffrey suddenly received
orders to go down and make some adjustments at the
big transatlantic station high up above Carnarvon, in
North Wales.</p>

<p>For two days he remained there, and then returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to Warley, where the Professor was still busy upon
his monumental book.</p>

<p>Alone with his private wireless set at one o&#8217;clock
in the morning, the puzzle of that curious cipher
message from the widow obsessed him. He wore the
low-resistance telephones over his ears, and was listening
to Poldhu sending out the day&#8217;s news to ships at sea.
It was better than reading the evening papers, for
here one had news in tabloid form, the news which was
printed next morning upon all the transatlantic liners.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, I will!&#8221; he exclaimed aloud to himself,
after listening to a declaration made by Mr. Lloyd
George to M. Briand, and reported by the Paris <i>Matin</i>.
He removed the head-&#8217;phones, and then muttered
to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder who this man Mildmay can be? I&#8217;ll
find out. It will be interesting&mdash;if nothing else. Yet
somehow&mdash;why, I don&#8217;t know&mdash;I took an instinctive
dislike to Madame Claudet. Yet there was really
no reason for it as far as I could see, and she appeared
to be quite charming.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he switched off, and retired to bed.</p>

<p>Two days later, having occasion to go up to Marconi
House, he snatched an hour and went to Ryder Street.
As he anticipated, the place was a set of bachelor&#8217;s
chambers. The liftman became communicative after
a ten-shilling note had been pressed into his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; he said in a low voice, &#8220;the fact is
that I don&#8217;t know very much about Mr. Mildmay.
Lord Bamford let his rooms to him about six months
ago, and he seems to be away quite a lot. I forward
his letters to Paris, Vienna, Rome, and other places.
He is a constant traveller. He must have business
abroad, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he have any lady friends calling upon him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Never to my knowledge, sir. He&#8217;s simply
a gay, irresponsible sort of man. Dines out every
night either with people in smart society or at one of
the expensive restaurants. A bit of a mystery, I
think.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>&#8220;Why a mystery? What do you suspect?&#8221; asked
Geoffrey eagerly as they stood together conversing in
low tones against the lift.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, about a week ago a little old man&mdash;a foreigner
with a grey beard&mdash;came here and questioned me
closely. At first I refused to tell him anything. He
went away. Later in the evening he called again,
and together we went round into the Haymarket and
we had a drink or two. I told him what I knew,
and&mdash;well!&mdash;he seemed much interested&mdash;very much
interested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221; asked Falconer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I may as well be frank with you. He offered
me twenty pounds if I would loan him the duplicate
key of the flat which my wife has in order to go in and
out to see to things for him. He has no meals here,
but his bedroom has to be seen to each day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty pounds! Then the little old foreigner
was very eager to see inside. I wonder why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. That&#8217;s in my mind. I haven&#8217;t accepted
the money, and I don&#8217;t know that I shall. Mr. Mildmay
treats me as a gentleman, and I don&#8217;t see why I should
go behind his back&mdash;especially with a foreigner. He
must be a gentleman, or Lord Bamford would never
have let his rooms to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Mr. Mildmay have many visitors?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only two or three men who are intimate friends.
I think he may be an inventor&mdash;or an electrical
engineer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because sometimes when I go past the door at
night, I hear the whirr of the little motor in the flat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! There&#8217;s an electric motor there&mdash;is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, in the scullery&mdash;it&#8217;s run off the electric light
current.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you ever hear any metallic clicks or sharp
fizzles and noises?&#8221; Falconer asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Nothing&mdash;only the motor. A little half-horse
affair run off the house current. When I was in
the army I had a lot to do with small dynamos.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>&#8220;What can it be used for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! I can&#8217;t tell. He keeps his sitting-room
always closed. He&#8217;s put a Yale lock on it. And my
missus is always wondering why.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey Falconer scented mystery.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does he want a motor in his flat for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I can&#8217;t tell you. He&#8217;s a generous man. I&#8217;ll
give him credit for that. But somehow I don&#8217;t like
his mysterious electric plant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Half an hour later the liftman&#8217;s wife, on pretence
of going to Mildmay&#8217;s room to see that all was straight,
admitted Falconer, who had a good look round. He
examined the half-horse electric motor, and found to
it attached two high-tension wires through the wall
into the locked room.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s his lordship&#8217;s dining-room,&#8221; said the stout,
youngish woman. &#8220;I can&#8217;t think why Mr. Mildmay
keeps it locked up so securely. Sometimes I think I
smell a funny smell, like paint, but I&#8217;m not quite certain.
It may be my fancy. Mr. Mildmay is out golfing at
Berkhampstead to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Falconer passed into the sitting-room, when the
first object that greeted him was a cabinet photograph
of Madame Claudet!</p>

<p>He had not been mistaken. What connection could
the rich Chicago widow have with the man who kept his
dining-room locked with a Yale latch?</p>

<p>The mystery deepened. A problem was presented
which to Geoffrey Falconer was fascinating. Madame
was rich and well known in society. What
possible connection could she have with that man in
England&mdash;the man to whom she had sent a message
in cipher. Cipher telegrams are quite admissible in
official correspondence, and also in business, but when
used for private communication are always suspect&mdash;except
perhaps between lovers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see Mr. Mildmay,&#8221; Geoffrey told the
porter, who, in reply, declared that the gentleman
usually came home about six o&#8217;clock, dressed, and then
went out to his club for dinner.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>So just before six o&#8217;clock Falconer returned to Ryder
Street and watched the entrance of the chambers.
He had waited for ten minutes or so when a well-dressed
fair-haired man of about forty, in golf clothes, alighted
from a taxi and, carrying his clubs, went inside. Then,
a second later, the liftman appeared in the doorway,
and gave the arranged signal that he was the person
Falconer desired to see.</p>

<p>There was certainly nothing suspicious about
Mr. Mildmay&#8217;s appearance. He was an ordinary
man of leisure, who had been out in the country
golfing.</p>

<p>Day by day, Geoffrey&#8217;s work taking him to Witham,
he was able from time to time to glance at the rapidly
moving pen of the &#8220;recorder.&#8221; He was wondering
if any more messages of mystery would come through
from the American widow. Each day he looked at
the register of wireless messages received from Paris,
but the name of Mildmay did not appear. He told
nobody of the suspicion which had arisen in his mind.
As a servant of the Marconi Company, he, like servants
of the Post-Office, was sworn to preserve the secrecy
of messages, and this he did. He merely watched
and waited, even without telling his father.</p>

<p>Yet somehow&mdash;why, he could not himself tell&mdash;he
felt that he would like to see more of the widow&#8217;s
mysterious friend. With that object he one night
put on his dinner clothes, and waited in Ryder Street
until Mildmay appeared, when he followed him unseen
to a small and cosy restaurant in Jermyn Street.
Scarcely had Mildmay taken his seat at a table against
the wall when Geoffrey also entered and took a seat
near him, pretending, of course, to take no interest in
anything further than the <i>menu</i> which the waiter
handed him.</p>

<p>Mildmay apparently told the waiter that he was
expecting friends, for the man swiftly laid two extra
places, and he had hardly finished when two middle-aged
men entered, greeted their friend, and took their
seats. Their appearance surprised Falconer, for they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
were flashily-attired, and evidently not of the same
class as himself.</p>

<p>In a few moments all three were bending towards
each other. One of the new-comers was apparently
relating something in a low, confidential tone, and when
he had finished, the trio burst into loud, triumphant
laughter. Then it did not take long to realise that
they were celebrating some occasion, for champagne
was soon upon the table and they commenced an
expensive meal.</p>

<p>Time after time Falconer endeavoured to catch
some word of the conversation, but failed. Yet,
whoever the men were, he felt instinctively that they
were West End undesirables. After their dinner, they
strolled together into St. James&#8217;s Street, where Mildmay
parted from them and turned towards Pall Mall, while
the pair went on into Piccadilly. After walking some
distance they entered a bar in Vine Street; yet Geoffrey
dare not go in after them for fear of being recognised.
Nevertheless, he had ascertained that Mr. Mildmay
kept rather curious company.</p>

<p>A couple of days later Falconer, glancing at the
register of messages passing between Paris and London,
saw that during the night another message for Mildmay
had been received. He referred to the tape record,
and found that it was in code, as before, rather longer,
that it had been dispatched from Tours, and was signed
by the initials &#8220;M. C.&#8221;</p>

<p>That same evening he called again upon the liftman
in Ryder Street, and inquired if the electric
motor had been running.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t heard it for quite a fortnight now, sir,&#8221;
replied the man. &#8220;Last night Mr. Mildmay had two
friends here: one man in grey, and the other in a
blue suit. Both were middle-aged.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey at once described the two men who had
dined with Mildmay in Jermyn Street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. That&#8217;s them, sir. Shady customers, I should
take &#8217;em to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just my own opinion,&#8221; declared Falconer. &#8220;But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
I&#8217;d dearly love to know why the dining-room is kept
locked, and the reason that half-horse power motor
is there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So would I, sir,&#8221; laughed the man. &#8220;But, after
all, I expect the explanation would be quite simple.
I&#8217;ve wondered whether he&#8217;s experimenting with something
or other. At one place I was at we had the same
mysteriously locked room. But it turned out that
the tenant was a doctor, and was experimenting with
the culture of the bacteria of deadly diseases. And
that was why he kept the door locked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This case we shall find different,&#8221; Falconer remarked.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t at all like the appearance of Mr. Mildmay&#8217;s
friends. I shall probably come and see you again
very soon,&#8221; he added, as, pressing a Treasury note into
the man&#8217;s hand, he turned and left.</p>

<p>On the following Friday, in response to a letter
he received from Sylvia saying that Lord Hendlewycke
had gone suddenly to Switzerland, and telling him her
mother would much like to see him to accompany
them in the car on their return journey across France
to Boulogne, he obtained a week&#8217;s leave, and duly
arrived at the Hôtel de l&#8217;Univers, at Tours.</p>

<p>On alighting the concierge informed him that the
ladies were out motoring, but an hour later he met
them on their return, and received a warm welcome.
His main object in travelling to Touraine was to meet
again Madame Claudet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Mr. Falconer!&#8221; she exclaimed, with her
pretty French accent, as they shook hands. &#8220;Sylvia
expected you yesterday. We&#8217;ve been having, oh!&mdash;such
a delightful time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It has been real interesting,&#8221; said Mrs.
Beverley. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been all over Brittany, and now
we&#8217;ve seen nearly everyone of the châteaux of the Loire.&#8221;
Then turning to Madame, she said: &#8220;Come on, Margot,
dear. It&#8217;s time we got upstairs to dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the first Geoffrey realised that the two ladies were
on most affectionate terms. They, indeed, addressed
each other by their Christian names. And he wondered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>Madame Claudet looked strikingly handsome as she
sat that night at dinner, dressed in a very smart, low-cut
black gown trimmed with silver, with a silver
ornament in her hair. Sylvia, too, looked charming,
in a flimsy dance frock of pale-grey.</p>

<p>As they sat together Mrs. Beverley explained their
programme, namely, to return by way of Blois, Orleans
and Fontainebleau, to see the forest and the château,
and thence skirting Paris by Versailles, Beauvais,
Abbeville, and Boulogne. That was agreed upon,
and later in the evening Geoffrey went out with Sylvia
for a stroll beneath the trees in the pleasant Boulevard
Heurteloup.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a dreadful time with Hendlewycke,&#8221; the
girl said as they strolled together. &#8220;He bored me to
death, and I fear I became very rude to him in the end.
That&#8217;s why he made an excuse and went off in a huff
to Switzerland. Of course,&#8221; she added, &#8220;mother
was furious, but now she&#8217;s getting over it. I believe
we shall never see him again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make too sure, dearest,&#8221; her lover said.
&#8220;Remember, he&#8217;s after money, and he thinks he&#8217;ll
get it through you. Lady Hendlewycke! How very
nice it would sound!&#8221; he added tantalisingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Geoff, you&#8217;re horrid!&#8221; declared the girl, pouting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you find Madame Claudet a very pleasant
companion?&#8221; Falconer went on, walking slowly, for
the evening was bright, and under the trees many
people were enjoying the cool air after the heat of an
oppressive day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. She&#8217;s so awfully jolly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she been with you all the time since I left
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except when she went to Paris. She left Dinard
suddenly, and was only away about fifteen hours. She&#8217;s
such a rapid traveller. I fancy I should have been
half dead with fatigue if I had done such a journey
in that time. She could have had only about a couple
of hours in Paris to do the business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With her bankers&mdash;was it not?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>&#8220;Yes&mdash;with the Paris agent of her bank. She&#8217;s
been selling some property in Brazil. She&#8217;s such a
thoroughgoing cosmopolitan&mdash;and mother is charmed
with her. She is coming to stay with us in London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; the young man exclaimed, reflecting,
however, upon those strange messages to that mysterious
man in Ryder Street. &#8220;Your mother seems devoted
to madame,&#8221; he went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But she&#8217;s really awfully good fun. Besides,
speaking French as she does, she&#8217;s been most useful
to us on our tour. I really don&#8217;t know what we should
have done without her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet you only knew her slightly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But we knew a lot about her. Wasn&#8217;t it
strange that we met her at Dinard? We shall have
a lovely run across to Boulogne. I suppose it will take
us a week or more,&#8221; the girl went on. &#8220;To-morrow
we are going to take you to see the Château of
Chinon. You recollect in one of your letters you said
you would like to see it. We were there last Wednesday
week. So we&#8217;re going again to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went on to ask him the reason he had wired about
Madame Claudet, but Falconer successfully evaded
her many inquiries.</p>

<p>On the following morning, with the three ladies,
Geoffrey was driven along the thirty miles or so of
delightful road to the ancient and obscure little town,
with its narrow crooked streets, the pretty Vienne
river, the historic, old-world place dominated by its
three wonderful châteaux: that of St. Georges, built
by Henry II of England, the Milieu, and the Coudray,
in which lived Joan of Arc&mdash;the three forming one
great fortress.</p>

<p>The guardian took them around the three castles,
to the three towers of Boissy, with its fine <i>Salle des
Gardes</i>, and lastly to the three-storeyed prison tower,
of which so many terrible stories of mediæval tortures
are told. Afterwards they lunched at the old Boule
d&#8217;Or, down on the Quai Jeanne d&#8217;Arc, and then drove
to Chenonceux on the road back to Tours, to visit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
charming little château&mdash;one of the most unique of
all Touraine, and which at that moment was in the
possession of a well-known American who had bought
it from the French Government.</p>

<p>Next day the four set out on the return journey to
London. Before leaving the Univers, however, a
very unpleasant incident occurred. Geoffrey had paid
his bill with a thousand-franc note which he had obtained
from the bank in London before his departure and had
received the change. Just, however, as he was entering
the car to leave, the manager came to him hurriedly and
asked him to step into the bureau for a moment.
There the note he had given was shown him, and
declared to be counterfeit!</p>

<p>Geoffrey stood stupefied, while the manager waxed
very angry, declaring that since the war France had
been flooded by spurious money brought there and
changed by foreigners. Falconer declared his innocence,
apologised, and was about to take back the note, when
the manager in fury retained it to forward to the Bank
of France for destruction. So he was compelled to
pay his bill a second time, and also to lose forty pounds
or so.</p>

<p>Then, feeling very crestfallen, he rejoined the ladies,
without, however, letting them know what had
occurred.</p>

<p>That night they stopped at the Hôtel Moderne, at
Orleans, and after dinner Geoffrey, without telling
them of the incident at Tours, warned them to be on
their guard against spurious French bank notes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Madame Claudet. &#8220;I have heard
that recently great quantities of forged notes have
been passed all over France. Somebody told me they
are being made in Spain. One has to be always on
the look-out for them. It would be so annoying to
pass one in innocence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, one could very easily fall into the hands
of the police,&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Beverley. &#8220;I had a
most unpleasant time in Dinard. I bought that little
butterfly brooch at a jeweller&#8217;s close to the casino,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and paid for it, when, to my horror, the man said that
one of the notes&mdash;one for five hundred francs&mdash;was
a forgery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do, my dear?&#8221; asked madame.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do? Well, I felt a perfect fool. I tore the note
up and gave the man another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never told me that, mother,&#8221; Sylvia remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dear. I felt too angry about it. So I didn&#8217;t
tell anyone. It occurred four days before we left
Dinard.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was upon the tip of Geoffrey&#8217;s tongue to relate
his own experience at Tours, but he hesitated.</p>

<p>The run next day to Fontainebleau was glorious,
and indeed the whole trip across to Boulogne was in
most delightful weather, and they all thoroughly
enjoyed it. At Boulogne they left the car to be brought
to London by the chauffeur, and caught the next boat
across to Folkestone and so on to London.</p>

<p>Geoffrey&#8217;s leave was up, so he had to be at the
Works at Chelmsford on the following day. He seized
the opportunity to run over to Witham, and there
discovered that during his absence Mr. Mildmay had
received two further cipher telegrams, one sent from
Fontainebleau, and one from Beauvais, both signed
&#8220;M. C.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now in his many conversations with the handsome
widow she had never mentioned that she had any friend
in London. On the contrary, on the night they had
stopped at Abbeville, while they were dining at the old
Tête de B&oelig;uf, she had exclaimed across the table to
Mrs. Beverley:</p>

<p>&#8220;It really is most sweet of you, dear, to put me
up in London. I know nobody there nowadays. I&#8217;ve
been away so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no mention of the man who occupied those
expensive chambers in Ryder Street, and as far as
Geoffrey knew the pair had never met. Naturally, the
young wireless engineer was often at Mrs. Beverley&#8217;s
house, and his own observations, combined with what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Sylvia told him, made it apparent to him that
Madame Claudet was a most extravagant woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are out every night somewhere,&#8221; the girl said.
&#8220;And madame will never allow us to pay a farthing.
She must be very rich, for she&#8217;s ordered eight new
frocks from Lucille&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has no friends in London, has she?&#8221; Falconer
asked casually.</p>

<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t have any when she arrived, but, of course,
she now knows one or two people to whom we&#8217;ve introduced
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the following day another curious telegram came
through the wireless station at Witham. Dispatched
from Marseilles, it had been sent across by wireless
from Paris, and was addressed to Mildmay. It was in
plain language, and read: &#8220;Urgent that Marguerite
should come over. The change would do her good.&mdash;Jules.&#8221;</p>

<p>This puzzled Geoffrey more than ever. Why was
madame wanted urgently at Marseilles, and what hidden
meaning was contained in the declaration that the change
would do her good? He was very anxious to ascertain
if she ever met the mysterious Mildmay, and for that
purpose he went to London one evening and again saw
his friend the liftman.</p>

<p>No lady had visited Mr. Mildmay to his knowledge.
She certainly might have called when he was off duty.</p>

<p>Hence Falconer determined to watch again, and after
the lapse of several weary evenings, he one night followed
Mildmay to the Savoy, where, just before supper-time,
he took a seat in the lounge and idly lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Geoffrey saw standing at the head
of the short flight of stairs the familiar figure of Madame
Claudet, wearing a gorgeous theatre wrap. Her quick
eye recognised Mildmay; therefore she went to take
off her wrap, and a few moments later joined him.</p>

<p>From a distance Falconer watched them closely.
Mildmay&#8217;s greeting appeared the reverse of cordial,
for on his face was an angry, morose expression. After
a brief conversation, they passed into the supper-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
where, in order to escape recognition, Geoffrey was
forced to leave them. But he had established the fact
of their secret friendship.</p>

<p>Next evening when he went to Upper Brook Street
he found Sylvia alone, her mother having gone to the
theatre with madame.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a shame!&#8221; she remarked. &#8220;Madame
Claudet has to go to Paris the day after to-morrow&mdash;on
some of her horrid banking business again. Mother
has introduced her to her bank in Pall Mall, so that
she has an account in London, therefore these journeys
will be avoided in future.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey, who had not allowed either Mrs. Beverley
or her daughter to suspect his doubt concerning the
handsome widow, agreed, and expressed a hope that
the lady would soon return.</p>

<p>Next day, having to be at Marconi House, he snatched
off a few hours in the afternoon, and succeeded in watching
madame leave Upper Brook Street alone, and
following her to Ryder Street, where she called upon
Mildmay. It was very apparent, by the timid way
she slipped into the doorway of the chambers, that
she feared being watched. Why?</p>

<p>She remained there for about half an hour, when,
emerging, the liftman hailed a taxi for her and she
drove to Upper Brook Street.</p>

<p>Geoffrey was perplexed why the mysterious Jules
in Marseilles should be so concerned regarding madame&#8217;s
health. Hence he determined to watch her movements
closely until she should leave Victoria. That night
he did not return to Warley, but slept at his club,
and at ten o&#8217;clock next morning idled unseen at the
corner of Upper Brook Street, in case she should come
forth. He had ascertained that she was leaving Victoria
at midday.</p>

<p>At about half-past ten madame came out alone,
carrying her handsome gold-mounted handbag, and in
Grosvenor Square she hailed a taxi, in which she drove
to a bank in Pall Mall, in order, no doubt, to obtain
money for her journey.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>She remained within about ten minutes or so, then,
re-entering the taxi, she drove back to her hostess&#8217;s
house.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later Geoffrey called to wish
the gay widow au revoir, and Mrs. Beverley invited him
to stay to luncheon. At about half-past eleven madame
left for Victoria, her hostess going in the car to the
station to see her off. Hence Sylvia and her lover
were left together.</p>

<p>Geoffrey Falconer had become disappointed and ill
at ease, for the mystery concerning the widow still
remained unsolved.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beverley returned, and they had luncheon
together, the young wireless engineer remaining all
the afternoon.</p>

<p>Just as they were seated at tea, Shaw, the footman,
brought a card to his mistress, who glanced at it, and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! It&#8217;s Mr. Elton! I wonder why he wants
to see me? Ask him in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man bowed, and a few moments later a tall,
clean-shaven business man was ushered in. In a
second it was plain that he was considerably perturbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Beverley,&#8221; he said, glancing at Sylvia and
Geoffrey, &#8220;I am very sorry to disturb you with a most
unpleasant matter. May I see you alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unpleasant matter!&#8221; gasped the South American
woman. &#8220;What do you mean? Whatever you have
to say can be said right here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a Madame Claudet staying with you.
You introduced her to me, and she opened a small
account at our bank,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well&mdash;I may as well
tell you that I have the police outside, and I am here to
give her into custody!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Beverley stood open-mouthed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Custody!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;For what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She called at the bank this morning, and changed
seventy-four thousand five-hundred francs in French
notes for English notes. These were, at noon, sent
along to the head office in Lombard Street, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
they have been found to be marvellously clever
forgeries!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; declared Mrs. Beverley, utterly
staggered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas! it is only too true. The bank has lost
nearly three thousand pounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Beverley, having explained how her late
guest had left for Paris that morning, refused to believe
that she could be guilty of any such fraud.</p>

<p>Here Geoffrey interrupted, and related how he had
unconsciously endeavoured to pass a forged note at
Tours, and he recalled to her mind the incident at the
jewellers in Dinard. Both those circumstances pointed
to the fact that the woman had taken from the purses
of both Geoffrey and her hostess real notes, substituting
false ones, with the idea of watching whether
they would be passed or not.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would like a word with the police,&#8221; Geoffrey
added, and with the bank manager he left the ladies
to recover from their sudden shock.</p>

<p>In the library he saw the detective-inspector, and
briefly related the mysterious messages received by
Mr. Mildmay, and the circumstance of the electric
motor and the locked room.</p>

<p>Within half an hour a priority telegram had been
sent by wireless by Scotland Yard to the commissary
of police at the Gare du Nord, in Paris, to arrest madame
on her arrival, while a visit to Mr. Mildmay&#8217;s chambers
revealed in the locked room a perfect plant for the
reproduction of French and Spanish bank notes of
various denominations, the most scientific and complete
ever found in the possession of bank-note forgers.</p>

<p>Two hours later, when Mildmay returned, he found
himself suddenly in the hands of the police, and both
he and madame&mdash;who was not a widow at all, but his
wife who had been distributing forged French and
Spanish notes all over Europe, and reaping a rich
harvest&mdash;later on received exemplary sentences at the
Old Bailey.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>THE CLOVEN HOOF</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;It</span> should be quite a pleasant trip for you, Falconer,&#8221;
remarked the little, middle-aged, well-dressed man
who was one of his superiors, as they sat together in
a room in the Engineering Section at Marconi House
on a bright October afternoon. &#8220;The plant went
out from the works at Chelmsford three months ago,
and we have been advised that it has all arrived in
Hungary, or I suppose they call it Czecho-Slovakia
now, and it is lying at the station at Arad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do my best,&#8221; replied Geoffrey, greatly
delighted at the instructions he had just been given,
namely, to proceed to Hungary to erect two complete
one-and-a-half kilowatt stations for continuous-wave
telegraphy and telephony. &#8220;I have never been in
Hungary, and it will, no doubt, be interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will. I&#8217;d dearly like to go with you,&#8221; laughed
Mr. Millard, one of the best-known of wireless engineers.
&#8220;The sets have been purchased by the Baron de Pelzel,
on behalf of the new Government of Czecho-Slovakia,
and one of the conditions of the contract provides
that we should send out an engineer to erect the
stations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will anyone go with me?&#8221; asked Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. There is, I think, no need. I myself looked
through the instruments before they were packed.
All is in order. You can employ local labour. There
are surely some quite good electricians in Hungary.
The first station is to be erected somewhere near Arad&mdash;wherever
that may be&mdash;and the other in some other
part of Hungary. We thought you would like an
opportunity to go abroad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey thanked the chief of his department, and
then, after receiving a number of other instructions,
he went down in the lift and out into the busy Strand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>Half an hour later he was at Mrs. Beverley&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hulloa, Geoff!&#8221; cried Sylvia as he entered the
room. &#8220;Where have you sprung from? I thought
of you down at Chelmsford with your uncomfortable
old telephones on your ears, turning little handles
very slowly, and listening! Oh, Geoff, you look so
funny sometimes when you listen! You look as if
your whole life depended upon it,&#8221; added the girl
chaffingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so it does, dear. At least my bread-and-cheese
depends upon it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the other day Colonel Maybury, of the Air
Ministry, told me that your improved amplifier will
probably bring you a comfortable fortune in royalties!&#8221;</p>

<p>The keen, smooth-haired young fellow shrugged his
shoulders, and replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I only hope it will. We wireless men are never
optimists, you know. We always look for failure
first. Success surprises us, and bucks us up. When
one is dealing with a science which is in its infancy
one must first look for failure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Geoffrey, as I&#8217;ve said before, you are so
horribly philosophic about things,&#8221; she declared with
a laugh.</p>

<p>At that moment her mother entered, and invited
Geoffrey to stay to dinner <i>en famille</i>. The ladies,
however, put on dance frocks, for they were due at
Lady Waterden&#8217;s at nine o&#8217;clock. So about that
hour, after Falconer had told them of his impending
journey to Hungary, he saw them into the car and then
walked to the corner of Grosvenor Square, where he
took a taxi to Liverpool Street and caught the train
to Warley.</p>

<p>At the Works at Chelmsford next day he was handed
a copy of a letter from the Baron de Pelzel, who had
purchased the installations on behalf of the Government
of Czecho-Slovakia. It was a private letter dated
from the Schloss Nyék, in Transylvania, recalling
the fact that all the plant had already arrived at Arad,
and asking the Marconi Company to send their engineer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to Budapest as soon as possible, where he would meet
him at the Ritz Hotel and consult with him.</p>

<p>A week later Falconer left London&mdash;after an affectionate
farewell to Sylvia&mdash;and travelling by the Orient
express by way of Paris, Wels, and Vienna, duly arrived
at the Hungarian capital. The moment he entered
the taxi to drive to the Ritz&mdash;that <i>hôtel de luxe</i> overlooking
the Danube&mdash;a great change was apparent
in what was once the gayest city in Europe. The war
had brought disaster upon the unfortunate Hungarians,
who, owing to the terribly low rate of exchange,
and the difficulty of food imports, were now half-starving.</p>

<p>As in the late afternoon Geoffrey went from the
station along the wide handsome street half the shops
were closed, and the passers-by were mostly thin-faced,
ill-dressed and shabby.</p>

<p>At the hotel a brave show of luxury was made, and
naturally the charges were high&mdash;in Austrian coinage.
The price asked for a room with bathroom adjoining
was enormous, but when he calculated it in
English money at the current rate of exchange it was
about two shillings and sixpence a night!</p>

<p>He inquired at the bureau if the Baron de Pelzel
had arrived, and received an affirmative reply. The
Baron and his niece had gone out motoring to Szajol,
a place on the River Tisza, and would return about
six. He had left that message for Geoffrey.</p>

<p>About half-past six a waiter came to Falconer&#8217;s
room asking him to go along to the Baron&#8217;s sitting-room,
which was on the same floor. This he did,
and there met a tall, well-built, very elegant, brown-bearded
man of about forty, with a round, merry,
fresh-complexioned face and a pair of dark, humorous
eyes.</p>

<p>He welcomed Falconer in very good English and at
once introduced him to his niece, Françoise Biringer, a
tall, rather slim, dark-eyed girl, very smartly attired,
who spoke to him in French. Apparently she knew
but very little English.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>Then when the girl had gone to dress for dinner,
the two men sat down and discussed the business in
hand.</p>

<p>The Baron seemed an extremely affable and cultured
man, as so many Hungarians are. He lived mostly
in Paris, he explained, but since the war he had assisted
his Government in various matters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will have an enjoyable time, Mr.
Falconer,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;When I was at Marconi
House they told me they would send out an expert
engineer to fit both stations and get them going. How
far do you think I can speak over the set they have
sent me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Speech should carry from seven hundred to nine
hundred miles&mdash;perhaps more under favourable conditions,
but Morse signals will carry very much further.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Baron seemed highly satisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, my Government is greatly interested
in certain mining enterprises, and it is my plan to set
up two wireless stations on either side of Hungary,
so that we can conduct rapid business from one zone
of operation to the other, and also with Budapest
when we so desire. But,&#8221; he added, &#8220;it is annoying
that the plant should have been sent to Arad. There
must have been some mistake. I went to Arad last
week and saw the railway people there. It has already
been passed on to its proper destination. But I do
not expect it will arrive for a week or even
ten days, so during that time I hope you will honour
me by being my guest here, as well as during the time
you are engaged in fitting the installation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall require assistance,&#8221; Geoffrey said. &#8220;Do
you happen to know of, say, two good electricians
whom I could engage as assistants?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will inquire,&#8221; replied the Baron. &#8220;No doubt we
can find two good men who, during the war, were
engaged in radio-telegraphy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Afterwards Geoffrey, well-impressed by the genial
Baron, returned to dress for dinner, and later on took
a perfectly cooked meal with his elegant and courteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
host and his niece. The young man found the pretty
Françoise extremely interesting. They discussed many
things at table, new books, new plays, and, of course,
the terrible havoc of the war.</p>

<p>The Baron was pro-British in all his remarks. He
deplored the ridiculous weakness of the poor old
doddering Emperor Franz-Josef, who, as every one
knew, was beneath the thumb of a wily adventuress,
and with vehemence declared: &#8220;We were always
Britain&#8217;s friends. We should never have opposed her.
Look at our poor Hungary now! Only ruin and starvation!
Until we can recover ourselves we shall be at
the mercy of any of the petty Powers who make themselves
so conspicuous and obnoxious at the eternal
<i>pourparlers</i> presided over by your Premier. We
want peace, Mr. Falconer,&#8221; cried the Baron furiously.
&#8220;Peace, and with it renewed prosperity. But there!&#8221;
he added. &#8220;Pardon me! I apologise. Françoise
knows that this constant casting of dust in the eyes of
our poor starving people goads me to the point of fury.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even though Hungary was in such evil case, and
half the population were starving, yet at that hotel
people&mdash;many of them war-profiteers as in London&mdash;dined
expensively, danced, and thoroughly enjoyed
themselves. To them it mattered not how freely the
bones of the poor rattled, or how many children died
daily of sheer starvation. They had money&mdash;and
with it they bought merriment and &#8220;life.&#8221;</p>

<p>After dinner the Baron&#8217;s car took them down the
Nagy-Korut&mdash;the Great Boulevard&mdash;to the Folies
Caprice, where they spent the evening at an excellent
variety performance.</p>

<p>That night when Geoffrey retired to his room he
was fully satisfied with the warm reception and
generosity of the Baron, and charmed with the chic
and verve of his pretty niece Françoise, who seemed
to have spent most of her life in Paris, where her father
had an apartment close to the Étoile.</p>

<p>Next day the Baron invited the young radio-engineer
to have a run in the Mercedes, and the rather morose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Frenchman, Lebon, who drove, took them out to Tepla,
a very beautiful spot with warm springs that have
been visited for centuries by the Hungarian nobility.
They lunched at the Sina-haz, one of the many excellent
hotels, and ran back through Trencsen, where they
pulled up to find the &#8220;Lovers&#8217; Well.&#8221;</p>

<p>After an inquiry from the Baron, who alone spoke
the Hungarian tongue, they discovered it just outside
the village, within the confines of the ruin of a Roman
castle&mdash;a well dug in the rock.</p>

<p>The Baron and the peasant who conducted them to
it had a short chat. Then Françoise&#8217;s uncle turned
to them, and explained in French:</p>

<p>&#8220;A most curious story this good man tells. It
seems that centuries ago a young Turk of high rank
and family offered a large ransom for his bride, who
was in captivity in this castle. But the lord of the
castle, Stephen Zapolya, demanded as the price of her
release that her lover should dig a well through the
rock. After seven years&#8217; hard work the well was
completed, and the spring is to this day called the
&#8216;Lovers&#8217; Well.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>With Françoise, Geoffrey peered down into the
pitch darkness, and saw that it was really cut in
the rock. As they did so, their hands came into
contact. Indeed, she grasped his instinctively as
they stood together at the edge of the deep well.</p>

<p>Then she withdrew her hand quickly with a word
of apology, and ten minutes later they were in the car
back upon the broad highway which led to Budapest.</p>

<p>The autumn days passed very pleasantly. Living
so much in Paris, as he had done of late, the Baron,
apparently, had but few friends in Budapest. He,
however, had much business to attend to in the daytime
on behalf of his Government, hence Falconer and the
Baron&#8217;s pretty niece were thrown constantly into
each other&#8217;s society.</p>

<p>She was a smart girl, full of a keen sense of humour,
and possessing all the verve of the true Parisienne.
She knew Budapest, of course, and acted as Geoffrey&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
guide in the city, but her heart was always in Paris.
She regarded the Hungarians as an uncouth race.</p>

<p>Her mother had been French, she told him one day.
She had, alas! died two years ago. But she had
induced her father to take the flat in Paris rather than
remain in the wilds of Hungary.</p>

<p>More than once Falconer wrote to Sylvia telling her
of the society junketings in Budapest, while the city
starved. Each night they dined expensively and
went either to the opera, or to the Vigszinhas to see
comedy; to the Fortress, or the People&#8217;s Theatre.
They also went to the Arena in the Town Park, the
performances at which were quite as good as in pre-war
days.</p>

<p>One evening as Geoffrey sat in the palm court of
the Ritz with Françoise, she exclaimed suddenly in
French: &#8220;I think we go to-morrow or the next day.
My uncle was with Count Halmi this afternoon, and
they were speaking of it. All the wireless apparatus
has arrived at Zenta.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zenta? Where is that?&#8221; asked Geoffrey,
removing his cigarette, for the pair were alone together
in a corner of the lounge. Françoise looked very pretty
in a jade-coloured dance frock, for a dance to weird
Tsigane music was to commence in the great ballroom
in half an hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zenta! Why, don&#8217;t you know? Has not the
Baron told you? It is his estate right away on the
other side of Hungary&mdash;near the Russian frontier.
I confess that it is out of the world, and I do hope you
will not be bored to death there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt I shall not; I have my work to do,&#8221;
laughed the well-set-up young Englishman, for he
was really having a most enjoyable time.</p>

<p>Hence he was not surprised when two days later
his host, the Baron, departed for the Schloss Zenta.</p>

<p>In the express between Budapest and Debrechen,
on the line which leads out to the Polish frontier, the
Baron, lolling lazily in the corner of the first-class
compartment, remarked in English:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>&#8220;I hope, Mr. Falconer, you have not been disappointed
with Budapest. Unfortunately I have had
so many official affairs to attend to. We shall be at
home at Zenta to-night. I fear it may be very dull for
you, as it is far away up in the mountains. I only
yesterday received word that all your apparatus has
arrived there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What height is it?&#8221; Geoffrey asked, as he was
concerned with the height of his aerial wires.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly know,&#8221; the Baron laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never
tested it with an aneroid. No doubt you will. It is
high, and that is why I thought it would suit you,
because I&#8217;ve always understood that aerial wires for
wireless are best on a hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly they are,&#8221; said Falconer, gazing out
upon the beautiful panorama of stream and mountain
through which they were passing. They were entering
the most remote, but most beautiful, district in all
Hungary, that which lies between the High Tatra&mdash;a
lovely mountain district known so little to English
travellers, save those familiar with the Carpathians&mdash;and
the Roumanian frontier.</p>

<p>At evening they arrived at a small, picturesque town
called Nagy-Károly, the capital of the Szatmas country,
nestling between the mountains, and at once a powerful
car took them for about thirty miles up higher and
higher into a wild remote district, the very name of
which was unknown to Geoffrey. Presently, just as
the night was drawing in, the pretty Françoise pointed
to a high-up château perched on the edge of a steep
rocky precipice, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! There is Zenta&mdash;at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>It looked, as indeed it was, one of those ancient
strongholds of the Hungarian barons who had for
ages resisted the repeated invasions of the Turks.</p>

<p>Later, when they arrived and the Baron showed him
round before dressing for dinner, he found that it was
a splendid old fortress, full of rare antiques and breathing
an air of days long gone by, while at the same time it
was also the comfortable home of a very wealthy man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>That night as they sat at dinner in the long panelled
dining-room adorned with many heads of stags and
bears, trophies of the chase, the Baron raised his glass
of Imperial Tokay and welcomed his guest beneath
his roof.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you have a very historic old place
which you are going to fit with the latest invention
of wireless&mdash;the radio-telephone. A strange combination,
is it not? All your boxes have arrived, and they
are in the back courtyard. I am sorry that I was not
able to arrange for expert assistance for you, Mr.
Falconer, but I have two very good electricians arriving
to-morrow. My agent in Vienna is sending them.&#8221;</p>

<p>And at the same moment Karl, the Magyar servant,
in his brown velvet dress and big buttons of silver
filigree, helped him to a succulent dish of paprika
lamb, which followed the <i>halaszle</i>, that famous fish
soup which is served nightly in all the wealthier houses
in Hungary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have the engines and all the other plant arrived?&#8221;
Geoffrey inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything. Twenty-eight packages in all,&#8221;
answered the brown-bearded man, while Françoise,
with her bare elbows on the table, glanced across at
the young Marconi engineer, and remarked in French:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you will be horribly busy now&mdash;eh,
M&#8217;sieur Falconer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mademoiselle,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I have lost
more than a fortnight already. But it has, I confess,
been most enjoyable.&#8221; Then turning to the Baron,
he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you engaged any operators to work the set?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question, put so suddenly to De Pelzel, nonplussed
him. He was compelled to hesitate for a few
seconds&mdash;a fact which did not escape the alert Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! how very foolish of me!&#8221; the Baron exclaimed
in his suave, easy manner. &#8220;I have been so terribly
busy of late, and also rectifying the blunder of sending
the boxes to Arad, that I quite forgot the necessity
of a staff to work the installation when it is complete.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
I will at once see about getting some ex-radio military
men from Vienna.&#8221;</p>

<p>For half an hour after dinner a gipsy orchestra,
four swarthy-faced men in brown velvet, with dark,
piercing eyes, and lank black hair, gave some wonderful
music with their violins. Then, when near midnight,
the man-servant Karl showed Geoffrey to his room&mdash;a
big, gloomy, dispiriting place, lit only by two candles
in ancient silver holders.</p>

<p>When Karl had shut the door, Geoffrey instantly
experienced a curious feeling of impending evil. Why,
he knew not. He was there upon business for his
company in that remote, out-of-the-world place, and
his host, the Baron, was most kind and affable, while
his niece was quite charming. Yet somehow as he
lay awake the greater part of the night he became
consumed by a strange apprehension.</p>

<p>At the Ritz, in Budapest, and also in the train, he
had noticed on several occasions a curious exchange
of glances between uncle and niece&mdash;or was it only
his fancy?</p>

<p>Was anything amiss? He lay listening to the
owls hooting in the great forest which surrounded the
castle on three sides, and reflected deeply. Françoise,
he remembered, had during the past few days questioned
him very cleverly, yet very closely, concerning himself
and his family. Could there be any motive in that?
In the silent hours of that night he became haunted
by dark suspicions, but next morning when he awoke
refreshed and went out in the autumn sunshine along
the terrace, which gave a magnificent view of the great
Hungarian plain for many miles, all his apprehensions
were quickly dispelled.</p>

<p>Inwardly he laughed heartily at his own misgivings.</p>

<p>At eleven o&#8217;clock he drove with the Baron about three
miles into the forest to a large high-up clearing&mdash;the
spot which De Pelzel suggested should be the site of
the new station. Indeed, two new log huts were already
built for the transmitting and receiving gear, with a
remote control to the generator plant.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>Geoffrey, looking round upon the dense firs which
screened them on every side save to the east, was
surprised that such a site should have been chosen.
But next second he recollected that the Baron knew
nothing of wireless requirements.</p>

<p>&#8220;To tell you the truth,&#8221; Geoffrey said frankly,
&#8220;I do not favour this spot at all. Results would be
far better if we fitted the station somewhere else, for
instance, near the terrace at the Schloss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I quite imagine it, Mr. Falconer,&#8221; replied the
eminently polite Baron. &#8220;But, unfortunately, my
Government is desirous of possessing a confidential
means of conversation between the two mining zones,
and I have granted them permission to establish it
here on my estate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the corresponding station?&#8221; asked Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will explain the situation of that later&mdash;when
we have decided upon this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Falconer was disappointed. He saw that the aerial
would be far too directional for the best results.</p>

<p>&#8220;This evening,&#8221; the Baron went on, &#8220;I hope your
two assistants will be here. This car will then be at
your disposal to take you backwards and forwards
from the castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>To protest against such a site was, apparently, useless.
All that Geoffrey could do was to warn the Baron that
the results were not likely to be too good.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he laughed, &#8220;I&#8217;ve bought the plant, and
if I choose to erect it anywhere, I suppose I am at
liberty to do so. You, Mr. Falconer, with your expert
knowledge, will, no doubt, be able to make it work all
right!&#8221; he said good-humouredly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; Geoffrey replied, and on his return
to Zenta he sat down and wrote a long letter to Sylvia,
telling her his whereabouts, and how the material
had been addressed to Arad wrongly, of his life with
the Baron, and of the rather unsatisfactory site that
had been chosen.</p>

<p>He wrote four closely-filled pages, and having finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
took it to one of the small rooms where Françoise was
sitting reading a French novel.</p>

<p>&#8220;The post goes out every night at seven o&#8217;clock,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;If you will put it in the rack by the front
entrance Karl will see that it is put with the others
this evening. Ludwig goes in the light car, and takes
the letters into Deva. They go by road to Nagy-Károly
to-morrow morning, and on by rail.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next day two shrewd-looking Austrian engineers
presented themselves as Geoffrey&#8217;s assistants. Both
spoke French, and when Falconer questioned them he
discovered that the elder of the pair knew a good deal
about radio-telephony.</p>

<p>They therefore set to work to open the huge boxes
of apparatus which had been over three months on their
way from Chelmsford. Each was marked, and they,
of course, only unpacked one complete set, together
with the aerial masts and wires. This work took three
days, after which the whole of the plant was carried
up by horses through the forest to the clearing which
had been made near the top of the mountain.</p>

<p>Day by day Geoffrey was out there with his two
assistants, first erecting the aerial&mdash;one of the newest
type&mdash;and then making an &#8220;earth&#8221; by sinking three-foot
copper plates edgewise in the form of a ring, and
connecting all of them to a central point. Each
evening he was back at the castle, where he spent
many pleasant hours with the Baron and his charming
niece. The latter, indeed, took him on several occasions
to see the most delightful pieces of mountain scenery
while the Baron, hearty and full of <i>bonhomie</i>, was
keenly interested to watch Geoffrey at work fitting the
complicated-looking apparatus.</p>

<p>Yet, curiously enough, Geoffrey&#8217;s strange feeling of
apprehension had not passed. He could not rid himself
of that creepy feeling which had stolen over him on
the night of his arrival at the castle of Zenta. Why,
he could not tell.</p>

<p>He was surprised that he had no answer to his three
letters to Sylvia since he had been there, but he recollected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
that Mrs. Beverley had spoken of going to Paris
for a fortnight or so, to do some shopping, hence it
was quite possible that mother and daughter had left
London.</p>

<p>It struck him, too, as somewhat strange that the
Baron&#8217;s pretty niece should evince so much inquisitiveness
concerning his affairs. When they were together
she frequently turned the conversation very cleverly,
and questioned him about his friends in England.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m terribly bored here,&#8221; she declared in French
one night after dinner, as she sat with a cigarette between
her fingers and yawned. &#8220;At last I&#8217;ve persuaded my
uncle to let me go back to Paris. I shall return very
soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you?&#8221; asked Falconer. &#8220;I expect to be
here quite another fortnight before we can get going.
Then I have to erect the other station. Have you any
idea where that is to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Uncle has never told me. But,
no doubt, it will be a long way from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The secrecy concerning the position of the corresponding
station also puzzled the young fellow. The
Baron had, however, promised to let him know in due
course, so he continued his work out in the forest,
and gradually he assembled the engine, generator,
and all the apparatus necessary for radio-telegraphy
and telephony.</p>

<p>One afternoon he returned to the castle unusually
early, and was surprised to discover the Baron&mdash;who
had not seen him&mdash;emerge from his bedroom and slip
down the stairs. On examining his suit-case a few
moments later he saw that the lock had been tampered
with, and all his papers had been overhauled!</p>

<p>What object, he wondered, could his genial host
have in prying into his private affairs?</p>

<p>By day the two Austrians working under his direction
were ever diligent&mdash;both being excellent fellows, and
very careful and precise in their work, which is most
necessary in setting up a wireless station. At night they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
remained at the castle in quarters which the Baron
had provided.</p>

<p>So far from everywhere was the castle that the Baron
seldom had visitors except on two occasions, when
two gentlemen, one a short, stout, thick-set man,
probably an Austrian, and the other a middle-aged
Russian who seemed something of a cosmopolitan,
arrived, and after spending the night, drove away
again.</p>

<p>From Françoise he understood that the Austrian,
whose name was Koblitz, was a Government undersecretary,
and the Russian&#8217;s name was Isaakoff, and
that their visits were upon official matters concerning
Czecho-Slovakia.</p>

<p>At last, one day when Doctor Koblitz had unexpectedly
arrived alone, the new wireless station in the
forest was completed, and Geoffrey thoroughly tested
the reception side, which he found gave highly satisfactory
results, considering the screening from the
trees. Both the Baron and Doctor Koblitz, together
with Françoise, took the telephones and listened to
the signals from Elvise, Rome, Warsaw, Carnarvon,
Arlington, Lafayette, Lyons, and other of the &#8220;long-wave&#8221;
stations. Indeed, during the whole afternoon
Geoffrey entertained them by tuning-in messages and
copying them from dots and dashes of the Morse
code.</p>

<p>Both the Baron and Koblitz expressed their delight;
therefore that evening Geoffrey ventured to ask where
the second station was to be erected, for quite ten days
before all the remaining cases had been despatched to
a destination of which he had been kept in ignorance.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Government have not yet decided,&#8221; was his
reply. &#8220;The boxes have been sent to Versec, close
to the Serbian frontier. No doubt to-morrow or next
day we shall hear what is decided. You said this
afternoon that you have finished, and that all is in
order to transmit&mdash;as well as to receive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Geoffrey replied, &#8220;all is ready. I have
only now to put up the corresponding station.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>&#8220;Could you, for instance, send off a message for me
to-morrow&mdash;say at noon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Falconer. &#8220;We are ready to
run and give a test whenever you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent. Then we will go over in the car to-morrow
and send out the test message&mdash;eh, Monsieur
Koblitz?&#8221; was the genial, brown-bearded man&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>That night Geoffrey failed to sleep. Five weeks
had passed since he left London, and though he had
written to Sylvia several times, he had received no
word of reply. If she had been in Paris, she was surely
at Upper Brook Street again!</p>

<p>He was ignorant of the significant fact that each
letter he had left for Ludwig to post had been taken
by Françoise and handed to her uncle, who had opened
it and read it in conjunction with Karl, the faithful
man-servant. Afterwards each letter had been burned.
This had been repeated each time Geoffrey had written
a letter, either to Marconi House, to his father at Warley,
or to any other person.</p>

<p>On Sylvia&#8217;s part she was still writing to the Ritz,
at Budapest, whence she had had a letter from her
lover, and they were retaining the letters expecting
the young English engineer to return, as the Baron,
unknown to Geoffrey, had promised.</p>

<p>Next morning broke chill and misty over the Carpathians,
and at half-past eleven the Baron, accompanied
by Falconer, Françoise, and Koblitz, drove to the
newly completed wireless station.</p>

<p>Inside the transmission hut as they stood together,
the Baron took out a slip of thin paper which he carefully
unfolded and handed to his companion, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;The call-signal will not be found in the official
book.&#8221; Then added: &#8220;As you see, the message is
seven-figure code.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey looked and saw that the call-letters written
upon the slip of paper were C.H.X.R., followed by
a jumble of figures interspersed with letters of the
alphabet.</p>

<p>The initial letter of the call showed that the station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
wanted was either in Spain, Portugal, Morocco, or
Roumania. No doubt it was in the latter country.</p>

<p>&#8220;The call-signal allotted to this station is the
letters O.S.R.U.,&#8221; the Baron said, after referring to
his pocket-book.</p>

<p>So the young radio-engineer at once sat down to
the key and tapped out the usual preliminary call,
followed by his own call and the call of the unknown
station he wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get them first by telegraphy, and then I will
telephone to them,&#8221; urged the Baron excitedly.</p>

<p>Within ten minutes Geoffrey obtained a response,
and after sending the code message by telegraph, he
switched on the telephone transmitter, and handed
the microphone to the Baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo! Hullo! Hullo! Petresco? Petresco?&#8221;
he called, holding the transmitter close to his lips.
Then in English he went on: &#8220;Can you hear me?
Is speech all right? This is a test to you. Please
tell me whether you have heard me distinctly. Hullo!
Petresco? Hullo! Petresco? This is O.S.R.U. calling&mdash;calling
C.H.X.R.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he handed the microphone to Geoffrey, who
at once repeated the query, and concluded it with the
words always used in wireless telephony: &#8220;O.S.R.U.,
changing over.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few moments there came a clear voice evidently
at a considerable distance, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo! O.S.R.U.? Hullo! Your signals are quite
O.K. Your modulation quite good. Congratulations!&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed the head-&#8217;phones to the Baron, who,
with great satisfaction, heard the speech repeated.
They were certainly in touch with the mysterious
station in Roumania.</p>

<p>While the test was in progress Françoise stood in
the narrow little room watching intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really marvellous!&#8221; Mademoiselle declared when
she herself put on the telephones and heard the reply
again repeated in a clear, rather musical voice.</p>

<p>Then, after another ten minutes, the Baron asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Falconer to switch off the generator and close down,
as they would be late for luncheon.</p>

<p>&#8220;It does you very great credit,&#8221; declared the owner
of the great estate of Zenta. &#8220;I never dreamed that
we should be in such complete touch so quickly.&#8221;
And the man Koblitz also tendered his congratulations
upon the achievement.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon Mademoiselle Françoise left
for Paris, and Geoffrey shook her hand as she entered
the car. After dinner Falconer smoked with the Baron
and his friend until about eleven o&#8217;clock, when he put
down his cigar and wished them both good-night. It
had become apparent that the pair wished to be rid of
him for some reason. Therefore he retired.</p>

<p>Back in his great, gloomy bedroom he stood for some
time at the window, gazing out upon the gorgeous
scene of moonlit mountain and silent Carpathian forest.
The attitude of the two men during that evening had
become suspicious&mdash;the more so because the Baron
had so constantly evaded his question as to the site
of the second wireless station, and also the identity
of the mystery station, &#8220;C.H.X.R.&#8221; Who, too, was
Petresco? It was apparently a Roumanian name.
Once again a strange intuition crept over him&mdash;a
premonition of impending evil.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later he removed his evening
shoes and crept back again down the great oak staircase
to the door of the room wherein the two men were
in consultation.</p>

<p>Bending he could hear their voices speaking low
and confidentially. But they were speaking in Hungarian,
hence he could not understand a single word.
Probably it was only politics they were discussing;
therefore, after waiting ten minutes, all the time in
fear of the approach of Karl, he was about to return to his
room when, of a sudden, he heard a few words in French.</p>

<p>Koblitz was speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I quite agree,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Your plan is
excellent. The wireless station must remain a complete
secret. This young fellow&#8217;s lips must be closed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
two men we have here are both good wireless men,
and are affiliated to our cause. Hence they can be
trusted completely. Falconer we cannot trust&mdash;even
if we attempted to bribe him, for he is an Englishman
and would accept nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you agree, <i>mon cher</i>,&#8221; the Baron replied.
&#8220;At the wireless station to-morrow he will accept a
drink from my flask&mdash;and then&mdash;well, the forest will an
hour later hold its secret,&#8221; he remarked meaningly.</p>

<p>Geoffrey held his breath. Could it be possible that
their plan was to poison him, and bury him in the
forest, now that he had completed his work?</p>

<p>It was quite apparent that the station he had erected
was a secret one, established for some illicit purpose.</p>

<p>He listened again, but Koblitz was only congratulating
his friend upon the success of what he termed
&#8220;the great scheme.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silently Geoffrey crept back up to his room. His
mind was made up. By his natural intuition of impending
peril he had been forewarned. Hence putting
on a pair of strong walking boots, he assumed his
overcoat and let himself out of the great rambling
place by a door he knew. In the moonlight he ascended
the steep winding path which led to the wireless huts,
and on arrival there, unlocked the house in which the
transmission panel was erected. Then, switching on
the light, he took up a hammer and deliberately smashed
every one of the big glass valves.</p>

<p>Not content with that, he also smashed every spare
valve, and then destroyed the insulation upon two
transformers of the receiving set, thus putting the
whole station out of action.</p>

<p>Afterwards he relocked the door and made his way
back past the castle and out upon the high road which
led down to Nagy-Károly. Through the greater part
of the night he walked, until at a small mountain village
he was able to induce a peasant to harness a horse and
drive him into the town.</p>

<p>Before nine o&#8217;clock that morning he called upon the
chief of police, and through a man who spoke French,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
gave him a description of the secret wireless set, and
of the dastardly plot to kill him and dispose of his
body by burying it in the forest.</p>

<p>At once the police official was on the alert, for the
Schloss Zenta, he said, belonged to a certain young
Count Böckh, who was a minor, and at the university
of Budapest. He had never heard of the Baron, who
had, no doubt, established himself there unknown to
its rightful owner, but pretending to the servants that
he had rented it furnished. This was later on ascertained
to be a fact.</p>

<p>Within an hour urgent telegrams were exchanged
between the Ministry of Police in Budapest and the
chief at Nagy-Károly, so that at noon, when the Baron
and Koblitz put in an appearance at the railway station&mdash;intending
to fly after finding that Falconer had gone
and that the secret wireless station had been put out
of action&mdash;they were at once arrested and sent by the
next train under escort to Budapest.</p>

<p>Later, after much inquiry, the police discovered
that the pseudo-Baron&mdash;whose real name was Franz
Haynald, a well-known revolutionist&mdash;had, with
Koblitz and a number of others, formed a great and
widespread political plot, financed by Germany, to
effect a union with Hungary and Bavaria. Austria
was to be overthrown, Vienna occupied jointly by
Bavarian and Hungarian troops, and Czecho-Slovakia
was to be blindfolded by creating a revolution in Jugo-Slavia.
The idea was, with the aid of Tzarist Russia,
to establish a great &#8220;New Germany,&#8221; which was to
be more powerful than ever, and become mistress of
the world.</p>

<p>This certainly would have been attempted&mdash;for
the erecting of that powerful wireless station was one
of the first steps&mdash;had not Geoffrey Falconer acted
with such boldness and decision.</p>

<p>Haynald, with Françoise&mdash;who was the daughter
of the man Koblitz&mdash;Koblitz himself, the servant Karl,
and twenty others are all now undergoing long sentences
of imprisonment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>THE POISON FACTORY</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey Falconer</span> stood at the window of the big
old Adams room at the Savage Club, chatting with a
journalist friend, Charles&mdash;<i>alias</i> &#8220;Doggy&#8221;&mdash;Wentworth,
of the <i>Daily Mail</i>.</p>

<p>Before them lay Adelphi Terrace and beyond the
Embankment and the broad grey Thames with its
wharves on the Surrey bank, London&#8217;s silent highway.</p>

<p>It was the luncheon hour on a day in early spring.
The trees along the Embankment, and in the Gardens
below, wore their fresh bright green, not yet dulled
by the London smoke, while along the Embankment
the trams were rolling heavily between the bridges
of Blackfriars and Westminster.</p>

<p>The room in which they stood was familiar to
Bohemian London&mdash;the world of painters, poets,
actors, novelists, sculptors, journalists, and scientists,
who lunch and smoke in the same great room with its
portraits, caricatures, and trophies&mdash;perhaps the only
spot on earth where a man&#8217;s worth is nowadays not
judged by his pocket or the estimation of his own
importance. Confined to the professions, it is a club
where as long as a man is a good fellow and has no
side he is popular. But woe betide the member who
betrays the slightest leaning towards egotism.</p>

<p>The members, leaving the little back bar, had already
begun to drift in to take their places at the little tables
which occupied half the big common-room. The
unconventional shouts of &#8220;Hulloa, Tommie!&#8221; &#8220;Hulloa,
Jack!&#8221; &#8220;Hulloa, Max!&#8221; were heard on every side&mdash;Christian
names and nicknames of men some of whose
names were in the homes of England and America
as household words, men of mark whose portraits
greeted one every day in the picture papers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>Just as &#8220;Doggy&#8221; was about to turn aside with his
guest, a friend of his approached the pair. A tall,
lank man with a furrowed face, &#8220;Dicky&#8221; Peters,
foreign editor of the great London journal, the <i>Daily
Telephone</i>, was known to both, as indeed he was known
to every journalist in London.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Dicky, what&#8217;s the latest?&#8221; asked Wentworth,
a man ten years his junior, but who was among the
most brilliant men in Fleet Street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing much,&#8221; laughed the other good-humouredly.
&#8220;Only that infernal Moscow wireless
press. It gets on one&#8217;s nerves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; asked Geoffrey, at once on the alert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go and feed, and I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trio went past the row of old leather-covered
couches from the &#8220;smoking-room&#8221; to the &#8220;dining-room,&#8221;
between which there was no partition, and
presently as they discussed a plain English luncheon
which even peers as guests did not disdain&mdash;for every one
is on equality in the Savage&mdash;Peters began to rail at
the wireless reports from Moscow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Falconer&#8217;s a Marconi man,&#8221; remarked Wentworth.
&#8220;Perhaps he can explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it at all,&#8221; Geoffrey said. &#8220;Of
course I&#8217;m on the engineering side. I don&#8217;t know
much about the operating side&mdash;except in experimenting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I think the whole thing is most puzzling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, one day we get the wireless press from Russia
and publish it. Next day we have an entirely different
and contradictory version. And, oh! the Bolshevik
propaganda&mdash;well, you see it in many papers. Sub-editors
all over the country are using no discretion.
We get all the jumble of facts, fictions, declarations,
but I never publish any. This latest propaganda
against Britain is most pernicious. In America they
are publishing all sorts of inflammatory stuff against
us regarding Ireland&mdash;all of it emanating from the
Third International&mdash;or whatever they call themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>&#8220;The Bolshevik press news should be wiped out,&#8221;
declared &#8220;Doggy&#8221; Wentworth. &#8220;No sane man who
reads it ever believes in the glorious and prosperous
state of Russia under Lenin!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree,&#8221; said Falconer, interested in the conversation
between the two journalists. &#8220;I often listen
to &#8216;M.S.K.&#8217; at night and read him, but his stories are
of such a character that I wonder any newspaper
publishes them. We never refer to it in our Marconi
Press which we send out each night to the cross-Atlantic
ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but how about the revolutionary propaganda
regarding Ireland? We get a pile of it in the office
every night,&#8221; said Peters. &#8220;I never publish it, but
over in America they get it too, and I&#8217;m certain it does
Britain incalculable harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was at a moment when a wave of Bolshevism was
sweeping across Europe, a hostility to culture and to
intelligence which had, in Russia, brought about a
terrorism which was assisted by a police system which
left far behind it the ideas and the proceedings of the
Tsar&#8217;s secret police. And those responsible for the
chaos in Russia were, it was known, endeavouring to
stir up revolution in Great Britain, and thus assist
Germany in her defiant attitude towards the Allies.</p>

<p>That night the young Marconi engineer dined at
Mrs. Beverley&#8217;s, and sat beside Sylvia. Only three
other guests were present, a well-known peer and his
wife, and a prominent member of the Government,
Mr. Charles Warwick.</p>

<p>Over the dinner table, in consequence of some serious
reports in that night&#8217;s newspaper concerning the advance
of the Red Army in the south of Russia, the conversation
turned upon the situation, Mr. Warwick expressing
an opinion that half the news concerning the Red
successes was incorrect.</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree,&#8221; declared Falconer. &#8220;Only this morning
I was discussing the same subject with two journalists
in the Savage Club. It seems that Lenin and his
friends are sending out by wireless all sorts of untruths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
concerning our rule in Ireland&mdash;allegations calculated
to incense other countries against us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s so, Geoffrey, why don&#8217;t you wireless
people try to suppress them?&#8221; remarked Sylvia.</p>

<p>&#8220;An excellent suggestion!&#8221; laughed the smooth-haired
young fellow. &#8220;But I&#8217;m afraid it would be
impossible to stop the wireless waves they send out
from Moscow each evening. When you press a wireless
key the waves radiate in every direction, and reach
far and wide. There is no invention yet to suppress
wireless signals, except to jamb them by sending out
stronger ones upon the same wave-length. That can,
of course, be done, but it would interfere with all wireless
traffic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody really ought to blow up the Moscow
wireless station,&#8221; declared Lord Cravenholme, an
elderly blunt man, whose wife was many years his
junior.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Warwick. &#8220;The sooner somebody
puts an end to their lie-factory the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Britain&#8217;s enemies are always ready enough to
believe any fiction alleged against her. And, of course,
the crafty Germans are behind all these attempts to
stir strife,&#8221; his lordship declared, poising his hock-glass
in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; exclaimed Sylvia, &#8220;I really think there&#8217;s
an excellent chance for you, Geoffrey.&#8221; And she
laughed merrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; added her mother, &#8220;If you could manage
to stop it all, you would certainly be a public benefactor,
Mr. Falconer. I read in the American papers I get over
some very nasty things about you here&mdash;all of it emanating,
no doubt, from enemy and revolutionary sources.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Mrs. Beverley,&#8221; exclaimed the young Marconi
man, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that such a task is beyond me. In
the first place, nobody can get into Russia just now.
Again, if the station were wrecked, Lenin&#8217;s people
would soon rig up another. So I fear that we are
suggesting the impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later that evening, when Geoffrey and Sylvia were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
alone together in the morning-room&mdash;the others being
in the big upstairs drawing-room&mdash;the girl mentioned
that the odious fortune-hunter, Lord Hendlewycke,
was to take them by car on the following day to tea
at the Burford Bridge Hotel, at Box Hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how I detest him!&#8221; said the pretty girl with
a sigh. &#8220;And yet mother is for ever asking him here.
I&#8217;m sick of it all. Wherever we go he turns up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because your mother has set her mind upon your
becoming Lady Hendlewycke,&#8221; he said in a low, intense
voice. &#8220;Why is she in London&mdash;except to marry you
to somebody with a title? I know it&#8217;s a very horrid
way of putting it, dearest, but nevertheless it is the
truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;But I hate the fellow&mdash;I
hate him! I&#8217;m for ever having headaches, and
pretending a chill in order to avoid meeting him. But
he is so horribly persistent.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her in his strong arms and kissed her fondly,
saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind. Be patient, dearest. He will grow
weary very soon. Be patient&mdash;<i>for my sake</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>But at that moment the footman entered, and
springing apart, they rejoined the others upstairs.</p>

<p>Geoffrey could only remain for half an hour, as he
had to catch his train from Liverpool Street. He
was back at Warley just before eleven. His sombre
old home was all quiet, for the servants had retired,
and his father was busy writing in his study when
Geoffrey entered.</p>

<p>Together they smoked for about a quarter of an hour,
after which his father extinguished his oil reading-lamp
and retired.</p>

<p>Geoffrey, as was his habit before turning in, entered
his wireless room wherein he had fitted that most
up-to-date set&mdash;a bewildering array of apparatus&mdash;chief
among which was his improved amplifier and a
double note magnifier of his own design.</p>

<p>He placed the telephones over his ears, and having
switched on the seven little glow lamps or valves of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the amplifier, and the two others of the magnifier, tuned-in
one or two stations.</p>

<p>&#8220;G.F.A.A.G.&#8221;&mdash;a great airship to wireless men&mdash;was
out upon a night cruise from Pulham, in
Norfolk, over England. He soon picked her up,
and heard her taking her bearings from the direction-finding
station at Flamborough, on the Yorkshire
coast. After which she spoke by wireless telephony
to her base at Pulham, and then to Croydon,
Lympe, near Folkestone, and to St. Inglevert in France.</p>

<p>Afterwards she carried on a conversation with the
air stations at Renfrew and Castle Bromwich. She
was told by Flamborough that her position was thirty
miles due north of Cardiff, going westward.</p>

<p>Such was one of the wonders of wireless.</p>

<p>His thoughts, however, were elsewhere. He was
still pondering over those budgets of lies sent out from
Moscow four of five times each twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>He placed his hand upon the knob of his &#8220;tuner,&#8221;
and raised his wave-length to five thousand mètres.
Other stations were transmitting, but he heard nothing
of &#8220;M.S.K.&#8221;&mdash;the call-letters assigned to Moscow.
Higher he raised the wave-length until, on seven
thousand six hundred mètres, he found that high-pitched
continuous-wave note, which he recognised as
the lying voice from the ether.</p>

<p>He took up a pencil and began to write down rapidly
in French a most scurrilous and untrue allegation
against British rule in Ireland, intended for the anti-British
press in America.</p>

<p>Halfway through he flung down the pencil with an
exclamation of disgust, and removing the &#8220;Brown&#8221;
head-&#8217;phones, switched off, and went upstairs to bed.</p>

<p>Next day, at the Marconi Works at Chelmsford, he
discussed with several of his fellow-engineers the scandal
of the Moscow Bolshevik propaganda, but each of them
declared that nothing could be done to suppress it.
Lenin and Trotsky ruled Red Russia, and certainly
the tide of lies sent out broadcast into space could not
be stemmed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>Sylvia&#8217;s words constantly recurred to him. She
had urged him to do something to stifle the pernicious
propaganda against law and order in Great Britain.
But how?</p>

<p>Many days went by. He was busy in the experimental
laboratory up at Marconi House, and had but
little time to devote to anything except the highly
scientific problem which he was assisting three great
wireless experts to try to solve.</p>

<p>About three weeks had passed when one afternoon
he happened to be in the great airy apartment at
Chelmsford where various instruments were being
subjected to severe tests before being passed as &#8220;O.K.&#8221;&mdash;note-magnifiers,
direction-finders, calling-devices,
amplifiers, and all the rest&mdash;when, with the telephones
on his ears, he heard Moscow sending out &#8220;C.Q.&#8221;&mdash;or
a request for all to listen. Then again came that
never-ending praise of Soviet Russia, which, under
the absolute rule of a little group of men, mostly Russian
or German Jews obeying the orders of Lenin&mdash;the
new Ivan the Terrible&mdash;and his war minister, Trotsky,
was, it was said, converting Russia into a terrestrial
paradise. On the contrary, it was well known that
Russia was a terrestrial hell, where torture was deliberately
being used on a great scale, and with a cruelty
that had never been surpassed, even by the Spanish
Inquisition. The recapture of Kharkoff by Deniken
had revealed a most terrible state of affairs, atrocities
of which even the terrible Turks would have been
ashamed. And yet the Moscow wireless was inviting
the people of Britain and America to rise and establish
a similar régime!</p>

<p>As Geoffrey listened attentively, his ear trained to
the variations of the sound of the signals of different
stations, it suddenly occurred to him that the &#8220;note&#8221;
was slightly different from that which he had heard
and discarded on so many occasions.</p>

<p>He called across to one of the technical assistants,
and he also agreed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>&#8220;It&#8217;s probably due to some atmospheric interference,&#8221;
the latter remarked.</p>

<p>Again the young radio-engineer listened. But it
seemed to him to be a different note, though the wave-length
was about the same. It was higher pitched,
and just a little more difficult to tone.</p>

<p>When any problem arose, of whatever nature,
Geoffrey Falconer never rested until he had solved
it. That was how he had invented his improved
amplifier. He had all the patience, the disregard of
disappointment, the dogged perseverance, and the
refusal to accept failure which characterises the great
inventor. In the days long past most inventors died
in poverty. Now in the days of stringent patent laws,
fortunes are sometimes made out of a new safety-pin,
or a sweet-smelling hair wash.</p>

<p>Though he carried on the important experiments
both at Marconi House and at Chelmsford, and also
at another station which had been established in secret
not far from London, he nevertheless each night when
at home listened in for &#8220;M.S.K.,&#8221; and diligently took
down all the wilful perversions of the truth sent out
by Soviet Russia.</p>

<p>On four different occasions, while listening upon
his own set at Warley, he became convinced that some
new station had been set up in Moscow for the deliberate
purpose of circulating the most glaring untruths concerning
events in Ireland. The text of all the messages
was now much more bitter than before.</p>

<p>Time after time he sat back in his chair, utterly
puzzled.</p>

<p>Here was a dastardly and insidious attack being
made upon the country by disseminating false news
by wireless, and yet nobody was able to suppress it.</p>

<p>One day, being up in London, he was re-entering
Marconi House by the back way in Aldwych, and
waiting for the lift, when suddenly an idea crossed his
brain. It was only a vague suggestion, yet that night
in the rural quiet of his home at Warley he listened
in for Moscow, and succeeded in determining the wave-length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
accurately. It was neither the five thousand
mètre &#8220;spark&#8221; transmission, nor the seven thousand
six hundred mètre, but lower&mdash;four thousand seven
hundred, to be exact.</p>

<p>Evidently Lenin had established an entirely new
lie-factory for Britain only.</p>

<p>Night after night Falconer, after his return from
the works, listened for Moscow&mdash;at seven o&#8217;clock and
at nine-thirty on &#8220;spark,&#8221; and at ten-fifteen on
continuous-wave. The latter was, however, absent.
It had apparently been cut off, and the new anti-British
station substituted.</p>

<p>Though Geoffrey saw Sylvia constantly, he said
nothing to her regarding the problem. Often when up
at Marconi House he met her at half-past five and
they had tea at the Savoy or the Carlton, after which
he caught his train back into Essex, there to spend
the evening in calculating and devising all sorts of new
&#8220;gadgets,&#8221; with the object of improving wireless
telephony&mdash;the science which must, in the near future,
revolutionise commercial communication.</p>

<p>The difference in the strength of signals from the
new station of Soviet Russia, as heard in his telephones,
puzzled him intensely. As an expert he felt that there
was something unusual&mdash;hence, to an experimenter,
of outstanding interest.</p>

<p>Therefore, he set to work to determine, if possible,
the exact location of Lenin&#8217;s latest wireless station.
With that object he one evening travelled to Lowestoft,
and at the direction-finding wireless station there
beside the sea, had a long chat with the engineer-in-charge.
The station is normally used by aircraft to
locate their position if in any difficulty with fog while
passing between the terminal aerodrome at Croydon
to Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, or other Continental
cities. The two direction-finding stations worked
in conjunction, one at Chelmsford and one at Pevensey,
on the marshes between Eastbourne and Hastings&mdash;a
triangle between which the sources of a wireless call
can be plotted, and exactly determined.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>For an hour Geoffrey discussed the problem with
Mr. Finlay, the engineer, who at once volunteered to
assist. Then Falconer left, and two days later arrived
at the Pevensey station, down upon the pebbly beach.
Here, too, the engineer-in-charge was eager to render
assistance.</p>

<p>Geoffrey and he were walking over the beach at
the edge of the sea, smoking their pipes in the afternoon
sunshine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call you up from Chelmsford on Thursday
night&mdash;if the mysterious station is transmitting then,&#8221;
Falconer said. &#8220;Listen, and you will no doubt hear
him on about four thousand seven hundred mètres&mdash;a
rather high-pitched note. If he is going I will
call you up on Morse and signal &#8216;Forty-four.&#8217; I&#8217;ll do
the same to Lowestoft. Then you can plot with Chelmsford
where he is located.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may not be in Moscow at all,&#8221; remarked Finlay.
&#8220;It may be some disguised station.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly my own idea. But we can, no
doubt, locate him, wherever he may be.&#8221;</p>

<p>So on the following Thursday night at about nine
o&#8217;clock Falconer sat in the direction-finding station
at the Works long after every one had left, listening
intently upon the four thousand seven hundred mètre
wave-length. He had waited in patience for about
twenty-five minutes when at last there sounded a long
shrill whistle, and the Bolshevik station began to
poison the ether with its lies.</p>

<p>For five minutes he listened. Then placing his
hand upon the transmitting switch, he drew it over
and spoke over the wireless telephone to both Lowestoft
and Pevensey, giving the code-word, &#8220;Forty-four.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O.K.&#8221; came the answer from both operators, and
at once they began to make measurements upon
the big maps in front of them.</p>

<p>All three direction-finding stations, at Chelmsford,
at Pevensey, and at Lowestoft were now engaged,
by working with each other in turn, in determining
the exact position of the Bolshevik lie-factory.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>In each station shrewd, clever young men, with the
telephones over their ears, worked the big ebonite
handles of the direction-finder&mdash;a piece of wonderful
apparatus in a square box with sloping top, and several
dials upon which minute scales were drawn.</p>

<p>The operator at Pevensey and the one at Lowestoft
exchanged conversations in a jumble of numerals.
Then Lowestoft called Chelmsford, and within ten
minutes the position of the mysterious station was
measured out upon the map, and Geoffrey, bending
eagerly, found that it had been located at a point
somewhere in the centre of Copenhagen, and not in
Moscow at all!</p>

<p>The anti-British station was still working on, as it
did every evening; therefore, three times its bearings
were taken, and each result came out the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, Lowestoft! Thanks, Pevensey! Much
obliged!&#8221; Geoffrey said over the wireless telephone.
&#8220;Switching off!&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked for a long time at the map, and with the
officer-in-charge of direction-finding he discussed the
matter for a long time.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Copenhagen it should be easy to spot the
whereabouts of the secret station. Indeed, upon a
large-scale map of Denmark almost the very spot
could be determined,&#8221; the direction-finding officer said.</p>

<p>Geoffrey lost no time next day when in London in
obtaining a large-scale map of Denmark, as well as
one of the city of Copenhagen, from a shop in Fleet
Street, and a fortnight later, with the aid of an eminent
geographer&mdash;a friend of his father&mdash;he was able, by
making careful measurements, to locate the secret Soviet
station as being in the Raadhus-Plads.</p>

<p>A week later, having been granted leave of absence
from the Marconi Works at Chelmsford upon another
pretext, he travelled to the Danish capital, where he
put up at the Hôtel d&#8217;Angleterre, in the Kongens-Nytorv.
In his luggage he carried his own supersensitive
receiving set, all of which he had constructed
himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>To the hotel personnel he made it known frankly
that he was a wireless engineer, and on a table in the
corner of his bedroom overlooking the square he set up
his instruments, after hiring from a local garage an
accumulator for his valve-filaments&mdash;namely, to
light up the seven little cylindrical vacuum-tubes of
his supersensitive amplifier.</p>

<p>On the night of his arrival in Copenhagen, after
dining alone in the big white-and-gold <i>salle-à-manger</i>,
he ascended to his room and sat there all the evening
with the telephones over his ears. He could hear
the British Admiralty working to Malta; Paris
working to Warsaw; Carnarvon working to Belmar,
and Bordeaux transmitting across the Atlantic. On
that starlit night the ether was alive with messages
by &#8220;spark&#8221; and continuous-wave being sent across
the seven seas.</p>

<p>For over five hours he listened attentively, but all
he heard was the usual commercial messages, most of
them in code of various kinds. Then he took off the
telephones and went out for a stroll along the Bredgade
as far as the Esplenade, in order to refresh himself
after his long and unsuccessful vigil.</p>

<p>Next day he wandered about the clean busy streets
of the Danish capital, idling before the shops in the
Ostergade, the Kjobmager Gade, and the Amargertov,
or reading newspapers in the cafés, the Continental,
the Bristol, or Otto&#8217;s. In spring Copenhagen is always
bright and lively, and he found the city quite
charming.</p>

<p>At night, however, he returned to his vigilant watch,
for the secret Bolshevik station was not now working
every night.</p>

<p>For five nights in succession he waited patiently,
hour after hour, but though he listened to thousands
of messages, yet &#8220;M.S.K.&#8221; remained silent on its
new wave-length.</p>

<p>Geoffrey Falconer was, however, quite unaware that
the adjoining room was occupied by a grey-haired,
undersized little man, who had been on the <i>quai</i> at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Antwerp when he landed, and having followed him
to Copenhagen by way of Kiel, had taken up his abode
in the next room.</p>

<p>In the hotel the two men passed each other frequently,
but Geoffrey was entirely unsuspicious that
his movements were being so closely watched.</p>

<p>He, however, as is the practice of most case-hardened
cosmopolitans, always kept the key of his room in
his pocket, contrary to the hotel rule of leaving it in
the key-office. When one is at a hotel and keeps one&#8217;s
key in one&#8217;s pocket, only the chambermaid&#8217;s or the
manager&#8217;s master-key opens the door. Hence intruders
are debarred.</p>

<p>On the eighth night of Falconer&#8217;s stay his suspicions
became aroused because he suddenly found the little
old man keeping him under observation. At first he
was in a quandary, but presently, after due consideration,
he resolved to act with greater discretion.</p>

<p>The Raadhus-Plads, as those who know Copenhagen
are well aware, is in the centre of the city, and the focus
of the network of tramways, just as is the Piazza del
Duomo in Milan. Time after time Geoffrey had passed
backwards and forwards across the spacious square,
but he could detect no aerial wires such as would be
necessary to transmit the anti-British propaganda
into the ether.</p>

<p>Each night he wandered into the square and gazed
up at the many illuminated sky-signs upon the shops
around, until he began to conclude that the bearings
taken at Chelmsford must have been inaccurate.</p>

<p>He had been in Copenhagen ten days when one
night, while seated in his bedroom at about ten o&#8217;clock
with the telephones over his ears, he heard the mysterious
station start up, calling &#8220;C.Q.,&#8221; namely, asking
everybody to listen.</p>

<p>And then on a pure musical note there was tapped
out a message, alleging that Britain was doing serious
injustice in Ireland&mdash;a message calculated to inflame
public opinion.</p>

<p>That it was close by Geoffrey detected at once. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
signals were too loud on the &#8220;second intensity&#8221; of
his double note magnifier, so he cut it out, and read it
loudly from one &#8220;Q&#8221;&mdash;or detector valve.</p>

<p>He put down his &#8217;phones, switched off, and leaving
the hotel, walked again to the Raadhus-Plads. Around
the square the well-lit electric trams were circulating
slowly, while all around were the illuminated advertisements
of motor-tyres, mineral waters, cocoa, and
soap, a picturesque night scene beneath the clear
starlit sky.</p>

<p>Watching him unseen was his little grey-haired
neighbour from the adjoining room in the Angleterre.
The old fellow was, no doubt, a very clever watcher.
As a matter of fact, he was Ivan Stromoff, one of the
most astute officers of the secret police under the régime
of the last Tsar Nicholas, now, of course, pressed into
Lenin&#8217;s service.</p>

<p>The secret police of Russia were ever corrupt, and
they had now been suborned by the Bolsheviks to act
in the interests of the Soviets as they had previously
done in the interests of the Monarch.</p>

<p>While passing across the Kongens-Nytorv&mdash;the
King&#8217;s new market&mdash;the fashionable centre of Copenhagen,
Geoffrey again realised that the little old man was
following him. So during the following day he walked
the streets of the Danish capital with the sole purpose
of drawing on the old fellow who was keeping such strict
surveillance upon his movements. Everywhere he
went the little old fellow shadowed him.</p>

<p>Therefore, at about ten o&#8217;clock on that evening he
managed to elude the watchful old man, and taking
a taxi, drove to the central bureau of police. He was
taken at once to Marius Lund, the director of the police,
and when alone with him, explained the object of his
visit to Denmark, and asked that he might be given
assistance in order to unearth the secret wireless station
of the revolutionaries.</p>

<p>Lund, a broad-shouldered, fair-haired Dane, at
once became sympathetic, promising all the assistance
he could render.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>&#8220;We in Denmark are always anxious to support
the Allies against the machinations of Germany and
Russia. So I will give you whatever help you may
require. Already we have been advised of your
presence here, Mr. Falconer, and I confess it has aroused
some suspicion, because you had in your baggage some
wireless apparatus.&#8221; And he laughed.</p>

<p>Falconer explained all the circumstances, how the
bearings taken in England had shown that the Bolshevik
transmission set was not in Russia at all, but somewhere
in the neighbourhood of the Raadhus-Plads
in that city.</p>

<p>&#8220;But had we not better obtain the aid of one of
the engineers at the radio-telegraph station here?
Mr. Petersen, the chief engineer, I know quite well,&#8221;
the head of the Copenhagen police suggested.</p>

<p>In consequence an introduction was next day effected
between the two wireless engineers, who sat together
in the big wireless station at Lyngby, outside Copenhagen,
the note of which with its call-signal, &#8220;O.X.A.,&#8221;
is well-known to every wireless man. There they
thoroughly discussed the whole matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;We experience no interference,&#8221; said the Danish
engineer. &#8220;But we use the six-hundred mètre wave
in transmission, while you say &#8216;M.S.K.&#8217; is under five
thousand mètres. Anyhow it is highly interesting,
and we will certainly investigate it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Together they strolled around the big busy square
at noon, but their expert eyes could detect no sign of
aerial wires. If a wireless station existed in that
vicinity it was certainly extremely well disguised.</p>

<p>Yet upon them both the little old man, who occupied
the bedroom next to Geoffrey&#8217;s, kept active vigilance,
though that morning he was followed by a detective.
It was apparent that by some means or other the
Bolsheviks knew of Falconer&#8217;s journey and its object.
That he was being watched was proof in itself that
the station, though well concealed, certainly existed
somewhere or other in the city.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of Marius Lund, both radio-engineers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
remained inactive during the following
three days, for the first point towards success would
be, he said, to get rid of the silent watcher, without
allowing him to suspect that he in turn was being
watched.</p>

<p>So the police called one morning at the hotel, and
finding a fault with the old man&#8217;s passport, ordered
him to return to Hamburg, whence he had come. This
he did with ill-suppressed chagrin.</p>

<p>Hence the investigators were free to watch. One
evening while Geoffrey could plainly read upon his
own set in his bedroom at the Angleterre the messages
sent out by &#8220;M.S.K.,&#8221; yet at the radio station, a couple
of miles away, they could not be heard by the operator
on duty, merely because of the difference of the wave-lengths
employed.</p>

<p>That night Geoffrey Falconer and his Danish friend
sat outside the Bristol Café in the great square, for the
night was quite warm and bright. As they gazed
around at the brilliantly lit Place, the busy centre of
Denmark&#8217;s capital, they were more than ever mystified.</p>

<p>Only on the previous day Geoffrey had received
from the engineer-in-charge of the direction-finding
station at Lowestoft a report of a further test, and
the bearings had not altered in the slightest. That
secret wireless station, which was endeavouring to
do so much harm to British interests and Britain&#8217;s
prestige abroad, was somewhere near them&mdash;but
where?</p>

<p>His companion confessed himself utterly perplexed
as just before midnight they strolled homeward.</p>

<p>Yet as soon as Geoffrey entered his room and switched
on his receiving loop-aerial&mdash;a wooden frame three
feet square, upon which was wound a number of turns
of wire, and which took the place of wires out of doors&mdash;he
heard the Bolshevik&#8217;s message being sent out strongly
across the North Sea to England!</p>

<p>On the following night the young Marconi engineer
determined to watch alone. He dozed upon his bed
until midnight, then rising and putting on his overcoat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
he went forth to the Raadhus-Plads, which was at
that hour almost deserted.</p>

<p>He took a seat outside the Bristol, and idled over
coffee and a cigarette until one o&#8217;clock, when the
establishment closed. Then he got up and wandered
around the square, not meeting more than half a dozen
persons, for the trams had ceased running, and only
now and then there passed a taxi on its way home.</p>

<p>Rain began to fall in a slight unpleasant drizzle;
therefore, turning up his coat collar, he drew into a
doorway in order to keep as dry as possible.</p>

<p>Suddenly, just after two o&#8217;clock in the morning,
two men and a woman emerged from a small café close
by, that had been closed for a couple of hours. One
man was carrying a suit-case which seemed very heavy
for its size, and as the trio passed, Geoffrey overheard
them talking together. They spoke in Russian!</p>

<p>Having realised this, Geoffrey followed them at a
respectable distance through the deserted streets, past
the Tivoli Gardens to the Central Railway Station,
where the suit-case was deposited in the <i>consigne</i>.
Geoffrey noted the case well. It was of dark-brown
leather, and bore the initials, &#8220;G.E.K.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the young woman left her companions and
went in the direction of the Lange Bridge, while the
men retraced their steps back to the obscure little
café.</p>

<p>Early next morning Geoffrey sought Marius Lund
and related what he had seen, whereupon they both
went to the railway station, and having interviewed
the stationmaster, the bag was obtained, and on opening
it with a skeleton key, it was found to contain several
portions of apparatus for wireless transmission.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; remarked Geoffrey, when he examined the
contents of the suit-case, &#8220;I can&#8217;t see how they can
transmit from that café. They have no aerial.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will investigate before long,&#8221; said the police
director, closing the bag and relocking it.</p>

<p>Within an hour Geoffrey accompanied him to the
café, a dingy little place to which no one apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
went. They had previously discovered that it was
kept by a man named Vedel, whose nationality was
inscribed upon the municipal register as German.</p>

<p>As they entered, leaving four police agents in plain
clothes outside, the man Vedel came forth, and behind
him the second man whom Geoffrey had seen during
the night.</p>

<p>The police director demanded to know where their
secret wireless station was situated, but they at once
denied possessing one.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall search this place,&#8221; said Marius Lund.
&#8220;You may as well tell us the truth at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Search&mdash;and welcome,&#8221; was Vedel&#8217;s defiant reply.</p>

<p>Hence, while the pair were prevented from leaving
the premises, they searched the whole house and went
out upon the roof, but found not the slightest trace of
a wireless installation.</p>

<p>They had drawn blank!</p>

<p>In chagrin Geoffrey began to wonder what the police
thought of the mare&#8217;s nest he had discovered, when
Vedel, believing that he was about to be arrested,
gave himself away by drawing a revolver and firing
a shot point blank at Geoffrey, narrowly missing him.</p>

<p>In a flash the police agents secured and disarmed
him, while Lund also ordered the immediate arrest
of his companion&mdash;who gave the name of Köbke&mdash;and
both were hurried off to the police bureau.</p>

<p>The wireless engineer, Petersen, was at once
telephoned for, and together they made a second
examination of the premises, when after nearly an hour
they found in the cellar a concealed door which led
into a second cellar beneath a courtyard behind the
house, wherein stood a small printing office.</p>

<p>In this subterranean chamber beneath the printing
office they found a fine continuous-wave transmission
set of one-and-a-half kilowatt power, together with
its generator. Apparently the printing office had been
established as a blind, so that the neighbours should
believe the noise to be that of printing machinery.</p>

<p>Then they searched for the aerial wires, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
a long time ere they discovered them. At last, to their
great surprise, they found them very cunningly concealed
behind and about an enormous sky-sign which,
illuminated at night, advertised the merits of a certain
brand of cocoa, a sign which Geoffrey had noticed
nightly, never dreaming, of course, that the secret
lay hidden up there.</p>

<p>The two prisoners who were proved to be dangerous
emissaries of the Moscow Bolsheviks, were convicted,
and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for establishing
secret wireless against the laws of Denmark,
the result being that the world has ever since been
spared the dissemination of the poisonous Bolshevik
propaganda.</p>

<p>And the credit of its suppression was certainly
entirely due to Geoffrey Falconer.</p>

<small>THE GREAT INTRIGUE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Hulloa?</span> Hulloa? Hulloa? Hulloa, Croydon?
Brussels calling!&#8221; cried Geoffrey Falconer one afternoon
over the wireless telephone at the aerodrome just outside
Brussels. &#8220;It&#8217;s Falconer speaking. Changing over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hulloa, Falconer? Yes,&#8221; came a clear voice
through the ether. &#8220;Changing over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you, Heddon. Would you please ask
Dennis to speak to me if he&#8217;s there?&#8221; said Falconer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right-o! Stand by, and I&#8217;ll try and get him.
Switching off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Falconer, seated at the operating bench in the small
wireless office, the window of which commands an
extensive view of the aerodrome, with the city of
Brussels in the distance, still retained the head-telephones,
and waited.</p>

<p>About five minutes later he heard the strong continuous-wave
sent out by Croydon, and a moment
later another voice exclaimed:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>&#8220;Hulloa, Brussels? Hulloa, Brussels? Croydon
calling. Dennis speaking. Dennis speaking. Over.&#8221;
Falconer drew over the transmitting switch and then
asked Dennis, the pilot, whether he was bringing over
the air mail in the morning. Receiving an affirmative
reply, Falconer said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do me a favour, old chap, and bring over two or
three things for me. You can get them put on passenger
train to-night if you&#8217;ll telephone to the Works at Chelmsford
for them. I want them very urgently to-morrow.&#8221;
And then he gave descriptions of two air condensers
and a double note magnifier and a microphone, adding
that the tests he was making at the new wireless station
he had just fitted near Dinant, on the Meuse, were
satisfactory, but he hoped to still improve them.</p>

<p>Dennis, having written down the list, promised to
bring them over by air next day, adding that he would
be at Brussels just about one o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>Then Geoffrey rose, handed the telephones to the
Belgian operator, and switched off.</p>

<p>He had been nearly two months in Belgium, and
had had quite a pleasant time. The Marconi Company
were fitting the new aerodrome at Bouvignes,
opposite old-world Dinant, with a one-and-a-half
kilowatt telegraph and telephone set of exactly the
same pattern as the new one they had installed at
Croydon. Bouvignes had been adopted as the centre
of Belgian civil aviation, air lines having been arranged
to perform daily services to Paris, Copenhagen, Berlin,
Milan, and other cities; hence it was necessary to be
in wireless communication with the aerodromes at those
places.</p>

<p>Only three weeks before Mrs. Beverley had brought
Sylvia over to see Brussels, as she had never been there,
and Geoffrey had for a week acted as their guide and
shown them the sights of the pleasant little Belgian
capital. Of course, during the greater part of the day
he was away at Bouvignes, but he returned to Brussels
each evening, and the lovers spent many happy hours
together.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>Now, however, mother and daughter had gone on
to Paris, leaving the young engineer to complete his
work in preparation for the official tests before the
new station was taken over by the Belgian authorities.</p>

<p>So next day about one o&#8217;clock Geoffrey returned to
the aerodrome outside Brussels, and asked the Belgian
wireless operator the whereabouts of the Handley-Page.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was over Ghent when I spoke to her five minutes
ago. She ought to be in quite shortly,&#8221; was the reply
in French.</p>

<p>So Geoffrey went outside and strained his eyes to
the south-west until he at last saw a speck in the distance
which each moment increased, until the giant machine
approaching came gradually lower, and after making a
turn of the aerodrome, landed gracefully against the
wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hulloa, Falconer!&#8221; cried Dennis, a round-faced,
boyish-looking fellow, as in his leather suit and helmet
he climbed out of the machine. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got your gear
all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>They waited for the passengers to land, five of them,
and chatted the while. Then from among the sacks
of mail from England he pulled out a small wooden
box, saying: &#8220;I went up to Liverpool Street and got
it early this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>The customs officer asked what the box contained,
whereupon Falconer, who was known to him, chaffingly
said it contained cigars. The good-humoured Belgian
only laughed, and shrugging his shoulders chalked
it as &#8220;passed.&#8221;</p>

<p>That afternoon, having an unexpected appointment
at the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs, Geoffrey
resolved to remain the night in Brussels. Therefore,
he had taken a room at Wiltshire&#8217;s Hotel up on the
Avenue Louise, rather than at the Grand or the Palace,
for in summer, both being down in the city, they are
unpleasantly hot. He kept his appointment at five,
and then walking back to the hotel, dined, and set out
for an evening stroll back down the steep hill into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
city, where at one of the little tables set on the pavement
before the Café Métropole, in the Place de Brouckère,
he took his <i>café noir</i>.</p>

<p>Unknown to him, however, a slightly-built, thin-faced
young man, who had been watching outside
the hotel for nearly two hours, had followed him,
and taken a seat unobtrusively near the table Geoffrey
had selected, but inside the café in such a position that
he could remain and watch.</p>

<p>There is always light, movement, and gaiety on a
summer&#8217;s night at that point of the Belgian capital,
for along the broad pavement passes a perfect panorama
of Belgian life.</p>

<p>Geoffrey had been seated for about a quarter of an
hour, and was idly smoking a cigarette when suddenly
a tall, well-dressed, rather elderly man who was passing,
caught sight of him, halted, and crossing to him,
exclaimed in excellent English:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my dear Monsieur Falconer! Fancy finding
you here&mdash;in Brussels!&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey sprang to his feet, for instantly he recognised
in the stranger a Frenchman named Henri Amelot,
a radio-engineer like himself, who was attached to the
powerful wireless station at Croix d&#8217;Hins, near Bordeaux,
which the Americans erected during the war for direct
wireless communication between the American army
and Washington, and which had now been taken over
by the French Government.</p>

<p>He had met Amelot at Bordeaux about three months
before, and he had been of considerable service to him,
hence their meeting was a most cordial one, and they
sat together for a long time, until darkness fell and the
great arc lamps shone above them. And all the time
the silent watcher sat idling over the <i>Independance</i>,
but glancing at the pair furtively ever and anon.</p>

<p>Amelot told Geoffrey that he was in Brussels in
connection with some newly-invented apparatus which
they were about to test at Croix d&#8217;Hins, while the
young Englishman explained the object of his visit
to Belgium.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>&#8220;Then your new Marconi set at Croydon gives
wonderful results,&#8221; Amelot was saying. &#8220;Your Air
Ministry ought to be greatly pleased with it. I was
listening to it at Le Bourget the other day. Speech
was marvellously clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Geoffrey. &#8220;It is an exactly similar
set that we are fitting at Bouvignes. My only regret
is that Monsieur Marvaut, the Director of Civil Aviation,
is absent from Brussels. He&#8217;s been away all the time
I&#8217;ve been here, and there&#8217;s no sign of his returning yet&mdash;so
his lady secretary, Mademoiselle Levie, tells me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marvaut was in Paris,&#8221; said the French radio-engineer.
&#8220;I saw him about a month ago. He went
afterwards to Marseilles. But you mentioned his lady
secretary. I did not know he had one. His secretary,
Charles Roosen, is with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mademoiselle Odille Levie called upon me on
the first day of my arrival in Brussels, and conveyed
Monsieur Marvaut&#8217;s regrets at his absence,&#8221; said
Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; remarked Amelot. &#8220;Then I suppose she
is another secretary.&#8221; And the subject dropped.
Later, Falconer walked with his friend to his hotel,
the Palace, and then continued his way alone up the
boulevard to the Avenue Lousie, being followed by
the silent watcher who had sat so patiently in the café
reading the <i>Independance Belge</i>.</p>

<p>Next morning at ten o&#8217;clock a waiter brought to
Geoffrey the card of Mademoiselle Levie, and on entering
the lounge a pretty, dark-haired, extremely chic young
lady rose and greeted him merrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard from Dinant that you were here, M&#8217;sieur
Falconer,&#8221; the girl said. &#8220;Last night I had a message
from Monsieur le Directeur to say that he is returning
to his country château on Tuesday next, and asking
whether you could make it convenient to visit him on
that evening. He is rather unwell, it seems, and his
doctor has forbidden him to come to the Ministry
at present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is his château?&#8221; asked Geoffrey.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>&#8220;The Château de Rochehaut, in the Semois, not
very far from Dinant,&#8221; the girl replied. &#8220;He has
asked me to get his official car from the Ministry and
take you there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very kind of Monsieur Marvaut,&#8221; Falconer
said. &#8220;Please tell him I shall be delighted to visit
him. I hope the wireless station will be ready for
the official tests by Wednesday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have the car outside
now. If you are returning to Dinant I can take you
as far as Namur&mdash;for I am going there. The morning
is delightful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing loth, Geoffrey quickly packed his suit-case,
paid his bill, and putting into the car the box of instruments
which had come over from London by air, got in
beside his extremely handsome companion.</p>

<p>But the driver of the car, a smart chauffeur, though
Falconer was ignorant of the fact, was the same man
who had so closely watched his movements at the Café
Métropole on the previous night. The morning was
indeed glorious, and the run out to Etterbeek, and
through the beautiful forest of Soignes to Groenendael,
and on by way of Ottignies and Gembloux to Namur,
thirty miles distant from Brussels, was most enjoyable.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle, bright and vivacious, was in excellent
mood. Several times she had come from Brussels
with messages from the director, and called upon him
at the Tête d&#8217;Or Hotel, in Dinant, where he had taken
up his quarters. Yet more than once it had struck
Geoffrey as curious that the messages had always
been verbal ones. And now it seemed strange that
the invitation to visit Monsieur Marvaut had come
through her, and not in the form of a personal letter.</p>

<p>As they were speeding along into Namur, Mademoiselle
suddenly turned, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect you may have to wait for a train to take
you on to Dinant. I have plenty of time&mdash;so I&#8217;ll take
you on to your destination.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hence he asked her to lunch at the Tête d&#8217;Or on their
arrival, and they took their meal at a little table out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
on the veranda which overlooks the rock-girt river,
a corner well shaded, where, seated opposite to each
other, they both chatted and laughed merrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw you one night about three weeks ago at the
Opera, in Brussels, M&#8217;sieur Falconer,&#8221; the girl exclaimed,
laughing. &#8220;You were in a box with two ladies, one
was elderly, and the other was probably her daughter&mdash;eh?
You seemed very attentive to them&mdash;especially
to the younger one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey smiled mysteriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;I did not know that you were watching,
mademoiselle,&#8221; he said laughing. &#8220;They were friends of
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your <i>fiancée</i>&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How absurd!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Whatever makes
you think that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&mdash;well&mdash;from your careful attention to her,&#8221;
said mademoiselle, raising her wine-glass. &#8220;When
a man is engaged he always has it written across his
back. Women can conceal their love, but a man
seldom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as, I suppose, women delight in tears&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! don&#8217;t let us be too philosophical. The
weather is too good. Let&#8217;s keep that for a dark and
rainy day,&#8221; she laughed, leaving her companion surprised
and puzzled that she should have been watching him
on that night when he took Mrs. Beverley and her
daughter to the Théâtre de la Monnaie.</p>

<p>From the first this very smart girl had puzzled him.
In the midst of his work over at the aerodrome on the
opposite side of the river she had come to him once or
twice with messages of unimportance.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as they sat together over their dessert
and liqueurs, Geoffrey recollected Amelot&#8217;s words,
and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Monsieur Roosen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Roosen?&#8221; she echoed in rather a blank voice,
gazing at her companion across the table. He noticed
that her countenance changed. But it was only for
a moment. &#8220;Oh! you mean the&mdash;the other secretary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
who always travels with Monsieur le Directeur. Ah!
I do not know, m&#8217;sieur. He is away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her confused attitude when he had unexpectedly
mentioned Roosen&#8217;s name struck him as distinctly
curious. Mademoiselle Odille was very charming,
it was true, but she was somewhat of an enigma.</p>

<p>Presently she put on her gloves, and rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, monsieur, for a very excellent <i>déjeuner</i>,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;And now I must leave you to your wires
and bewildering apparatus, and get back to Namur
and on to Brussels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must come and see the official tests on Wednesday,
mademoiselle. No doubt you will like to hear
the wireless telephone,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall. I&#8217;m intensely interested,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;But remember on Tuesday I will meet you here at
about seven and take you over to the Château de
Rochehaut.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she got into the car and drove away.</p>

<p>Geoffrey telephoned over to the aerodrome to send
the service car over for the box of apparatus, and when
it arrived, he drove across the river and through the
ancient village of Bouvignes. The old place, surmounted
by the ancient ruins of Crêve C&oelig;ur, the
castle where the Three Ladies of Crêve C&oelig;ur, sole
survivors of the garrison besieged by the Duc de Nevers
in 1554, hurled themselves from the tower to death
in the eyes of their French conquerors, was quiet and out
of the world. But Geoffrey was much preoccupied
as the car tore through the dusty village and away
up to the plain, where the great new aviation ground
was being constructed.</p>

<p>On one side stood the row of up-to-date hangars,
with all the latest inventions of British and French
aviation, while on the other, facing it, rose the aerial
wires on eighty-feet poles temporarily erected, for the
lattice masts were in process of manufacture.</p>

<p>In two long army huts, situated a short distance
from each other, the wireless office had been established.
One of them housed the generator and transmitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
gear, while in the other was the operating key and
reception set. To the latter hut Geoffrey went, and
there, with the assistance of a Belgian wireless operator,
he unpacked the double-note magnifier and condensers
which had travelled by air from Croydon.</p>

<p>Then throughout the remainder of the afternoon
the keen young engineer was engaged in setting them
up upon the operating bench. With many patient
tests he listened-in constantly for various stations of
between nine hundred and sixteen hundred mètres.
The small oblong box, on the ebonite top of which were
fixed two little vacuum tubes which shone brightly
when current was passed through them&mdash;the piece of
apparatus used in conjunction with the seven-valve
amplifier&mdash;magnified the weakest signal to such
an extent that the telephones could hardly be borne
upon his ears.</p>

<p>He had another there, but it somehow did not give
such good results as the one he had just requisitioned
from Chelmsford. As a matter of fact, it was one of
a rather newer design, for wireless apparatus is every
week improving. And so rapid is the advance of radio
discoveries that much of the latest experimental
apparatus to-day will six months hence be relegated
to the scrap-heap.</p>

<p>Through the whole afternoon he worked on patiently,
joining up the receiving circuit of many wires, the
transmission side being already in running order.
Only three days before he had spoken over the radio-telephone
to Croydon, Lympe, Pulham in Norfolk,
Le Bourget, and Cologne. Each test gave excellent
results, even though the atmospheric conditions were
none too good.</p>

<p>So he had every hope of the official tests being satisfactory.
As a loyal and trusted servant of that
wonderful organisation, the Marconi Company, he
had worked hard and done his level utmost to make
the Bouvignes station a credit to his employers. Hence
he was most anxious that on the great day when the
final tests were made everything should go right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and that signals by continuous-wave telegraphy,
direction-finding, and radio-telephony should be equally
satisfactory.</p>

<p>He was listening to Paris transmitting to Bucharest,
reading the commercial messages, and gazing through
the small window of the Army hut away across the
grass-covered aerodrome to where, below, the winding
Meuse lay bathed in the soft evening light. Still
listening, he raised his wave-length until he heard
the peculiar arc note of N.S.S.&mdash;which is Annapolis
in the United States&mdash;sending its time signals, for it
wanted a minute to five o&#8217;clock. Having compared
the time with the big round clock above the bench
he reduced his wave-length to one thousand mètres,
when suddenly he heard the shrill high-pitched note
of a continuous-wave transmitter which sounded as
though it were in the near vicinity.</p>

<p>It was calling S.R.4. repeatedly, without giving its
own call-sign. But as the wireless station being called
did not appear in the official register at his elbow, he
took it to be some private station and disregarded it.</p>

<p>At that moment Captain Hanateau, who was in charge
of the new aerodrome, entered the hut, saying in good
English:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a telegram for you, Meester Falconer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey thanked him, tore open the message, but
as he read it, he held his breath in anxiety and astonishment.
His heart stood still.</p>

<p>It was from Mrs. Beverley, dated from the Grand
Hotel, in Paris, asking whether Sylvia was with him.
Four days before she had suddenly packed a small
dressing-case during her mother&#8217;s absence, and left
the hotel, leaving behind a note stating that in consequence
of an urgent telegram from Geoffrey she had
gone back to Brussels and would write.</p>

<p>Geoffrey had sent no telegram! What could have
happened?</p>

<p>The Captain saw that the news distressed the young
radio-engineer, and expressed his regret if the message
was disconcerting.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; replied the young man as he removed
the telephones from his ears and re-read the long
message. &#8220;Is the car in use? I must go to Brussels
at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can have it, of course. I&#8217;ll go and order it
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Therefore, a quarter of an hour later Geoffrey was
speeding back over the dusty road to Brussels. On
arrival his first inquiry was at the Palace Hotel, where
Sylvia had stayed with her mother. Nobody, however,
had seen her there since her departure for Paris. He
drove up the boulevard to Wiltshire&#8217;s, and there made
similar inquiry, but to no purpose. To other places
he went that night, making diligent inquiry everywhere,
and then he drove out to the aerodrome, for she
had been with him there once or twice. But no trace
could he discover of her.</p>

<p>So at eleven o&#8217;clock he sent a telegram to her mother
saying that he had not seen her, and that apparently
she had not come to Brussels. He added that he had
sent her no telegram.</p>

<p>Sylvia, to whom he was so devoted, was missing!
But why?</p>

<p>Just before midnight, so perturbed had he become,
that he went to the Bureau of Police, and there saw
Monsieur Guiette, the well-known Belgian <i>chef de
la Sûreté</i>. To him he told the story, after explaining
who he was. The official heard him patiently, and
promised to have some inquiries made. He suggested,
however, that inquiries should be also made in Paris,
as perhaps the young lady had not left for Brussels
after all.</p>

<p>&#8220;She may have gone to London with some motive
known only to herself,&#8221; Monsieur Guiette suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the telegram which purported to have been
sent by me must have been despatched from Brussels,&#8221;
urged Falconer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Agreed, monsieur, but that telegram does not
appear to have been seen. The young lady herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
says that she received a message from you. She
evidently did not leave it for her mother to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>At two o&#8217;clock next morning Geoffrey was in the
express for Paris, where he arrived at breakfast time,
and in frantic haste sought Mrs. Beverley.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think what can have happened,&#8221; she said
in great distress. &#8220;The other morning I went out to
Armenonville with my friend, Mrs. Bridges, but Sylvia
could not come, as she had an appointment at her
dressmaker, Martin&#8217;s, in the Rue de la Paix. When
we returned at one o&#8217;clock we found that she had gone,
leaving this note.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey read the scribbled note of his well-beloved,
which explained how soon after her mother had gone
she received a wire from him urging her to come to
Brussels at once, as he was in a great difficulty, so she
had caught the next train.</p>

<p>Falconer stood staggered. He had sent no telegram,
and he certainly was in no difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is curious that she did not leave the telegram
for you to see,&#8221; remarked the young radio-engineer.</p>

<p>&#8220;She forgot it, I suppose,&#8221; replied the mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;True, but it may be that she did not go to Brussels
at all! The police will probably assist us, though
they are never very anxious to help when people leave
home of their own accord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do go and see them, Geoffrey. Do go!&#8221;
Mrs. Beverley implored, for she was in a terribly agitated
state of mind. She had inquired of the servants at
Upper Brook Street, but they had seen nothing of
Miss Sylvia.</p>

<p>Geoffrey, spurred to activity by his deep affection
for the girl, took a taxi at once to the Prefecture of
Police, and a detective was detailed to go with him
to the Gare du Nord and there prosecute inquiries.
From the stationmaster they learnt that the person
who had booked passengers by the Brussels express
on the morning of Sylvia&#8217;s departure was a certain
Mademoiselle Le Grelle. She was also on duty at the
booking-office at that moment; therefore, they at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
sought her, and the detective closely questioned her
as to whether the young English lady, whom Geoffrey
described, had taken a ticket for Brussels on the
morning in question.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle reflected for a few moments, and
then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I recollect quite well. A young English
lady asked me the quickest route to Brussels. I told
her that the quickest was by Maubeuge, but the direct,
without change, was by Amiens and Valenciennes.
She chose the later route. The lady I mean wore a
long pale-grey cloak and a small hat trimmed with
blue. She was the only girl from Paris by that train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Sylvia!&#8221; gasped Falconer. &#8220;She has a
grey cloak. Then she did go to Brussels&mdash;after all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Apparently, m&#8217;sieur,&#8221; remarked the detective.
&#8220;It is certainly for the Brussels police to inquire at
once whether she arrived there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Back at the Grand Hotel he related to Mrs. Beverley
Mademoiselle Le Grelle&#8217;s statement, her description
of her dress, and the small dressing-case she carried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Geoffrey,&#8221; exclaimed the anxious widow
&#8220;I&#8217;m at my wits&#8217; ends to know what to do, or
how to act. My girl has disappeared. Surely she had
no secret appointment with anybody?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel certain she had not,&#8221; declared Falconer.
&#8220;There&#8217;s some deep plotting at work somewhere. Of
that I&#8217;m absolutely convinced. But we now have
the first clue to her, and we must follow it up without
a moment&#8217;s delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I agree,&#8221; said Mrs. Beverley, standing at the
window of her private sitting-room, which looked out
upon the busy boulevard. &#8220;We at least know that
she actually left for Brussels. And if she did&mdash;then
she went there to meet you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I sent her no urgent telegram! I wrote to
her about a week ago saying that I expected to be back
home in ten days&mdash;after the official tests were through.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was then about one o&#8217;clock, so Falconer ate a hurried
lunch with Sylvia&#8217;s mother down in the big restaurant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and at three o&#8217;clock returned to Brussels. He was not
a man to allow the grass to grow under his feet, for again
before eleven o&#8217;clock&mdash;while Mrs. Beverley elected to
wait for news of her daughter in Paris&mdash;he was closeted
once more with the famous detective, Monsieur Guiette.</p>

<p>The astute, bald-headed little man heard him
through, nodding ever and anon, until at last, he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Bien!</i> M&#8217;sieur Falconer. I will have every inquiry
made to-morrow, and will send you word to&mdash;where?&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey hesitated. He was in the midst of the
serious wireless tests, and had arranged with other
stations to listen-in for his speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it will be best to telephone to me at the Tête
d&#8217;Or at Dinant, or to the new aerodrome at Bouvignes,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>And then he took his hat, and departing, ascended
the hill to the Avenue Louise, where he spent a sleepless
night at the hotel.</p>

<p>Sylvia, his beloved Sylvia, was missing! Had
she fallen victim to some evil and cleverly conceived
plot? In the dark hours of the night he became
seized by all sorts of terrible apprehensions. That
false telegram sent from Belgium showed a distinct
malice aforethought, She had, without doubt, fallen
into the hands of enemies.</p>

<p>But where?</p>

<p>Unable to sleep, he rose, opened the window, and
gazed forth upon the well-lit leafy avenue, so gay and
brilliant by day, but now entirely silent save for the
soft rustling of the leaves. It was three o&#8217;clock in the
morning, and he had travelled many miles to and fro
to France since last he had slept.</p>

<p>Sylvia&#8217;s disappearance was a mystery, deep and
inscrutable.</p>

<p>Without some strong motive, such as the receipt
of the telegram of distress, she would certainly never
have left her mother and travelled so hastily back
to Brussels.</p>

<p>For over an hour he sat at the open window trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
to solve the problem, and hoping that Monsieur Guiette&#8217;s
inquiries would have some result. She would certainly
have to show her passport at the frontier, where a
register would be kept.</p>

<p>Day broke, but he did not return to bed. At five
he dressed, and then, after his coffee, he strolled
anxiously down the Montagne de la Cour in the morning
sunshine towards the Bourse, waiting for midday,
when he had arranged to call again at the Prefecture,
and hear the result of the inquiries at the frontier.</p>

<p>Noon came at last, and he again sat in Monsieur
Guiette&#8217;s dull drab room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, m&#8217;sieur,&#8221; exclaimed the bald-headed little
official, &#8220;it seems that mademoiselle, the South Américaine,
left Paris as you allege, travelled by the train
you mention, and showed her passport at the frontier.
She told the passport officer that she was going to the
Palace Hotel here, but evidently on arrival changed
her mind. Then,&#8221; he added, &#8220;she was noted by the
police at the barrier when she arrived, and was seen to
be met by somebody&mdash;a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Met by a woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Here our information becomes a little
hazy,&#8221; replied the great detective. &#8220;One witness
says that the woman outside the barrier rushed up to
her and gave her some message, while another witness,
the collector of tickets, declares that it was a little
old man who speaks English, and sometimes acts as
guide, who met her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what happened then?&#8221; exclaimed Geoffrey
bewildered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both persons tell the same story, that a car was
in waiting, and that the young lady entered it very
hurriedly, apparently much upset at what had been
told her, and was driven away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Driven away into the unknown&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly, m&#8217;sieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how shall we now follow her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Monsieur Guiette raised his shoulders, and after a
moment&#8217;s silence, answered:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>&#8220;The young lady has simply disappeared. We
have had in the years of my service, both before the
war and since, a number of such cases of English and
American ladies being lost in Belgium. But such cases
are always difficult to deal with. Girls have lovers&mdash;secret
lovers&mdash;so very often. And when at last traced
they are always highly indignant&mdash;and never tell us
the truth. Ah! m&#8217;sieur, when one deals with love
one is always mystified.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But in the present case I am convinced that Miss
Beverley has fallen victim to some plot. She received
a telegram purporting to have come from myself,
whereas I sent her no message. She obeyed my wish,
and on arrival here was given a false message, to which
she instantly responded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, m&#8217;sieur; I quite agree. But we cannot
go further. How can we?&#8221; asked the famous
commissary.</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly think we ought to. A lady has been
enticed to Brussels by a false telegram, and it is the
duty of the police to follow up the clue which I have
supplied!&#8221; exclaimed Geoffrey in indignation at the
apparent reluctance of Guiette to carry the inquiry
further.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, do not be distressed,&#8221; said the famous
detective pleasantly. &#8220;I have already given orders
that the inquiries are to be pushed forward in every
quarter. The case interests me personally. And,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;I entirely agree with you. There is some
very deep-laid plot, otherwise that urgent telegram
would never have been forged.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey was now torn between love and duty.
From the Prefecture he at once walked to the Place
de la Monnaie, and from the central telegraph office
despatched a long message to the missing girl&#8217;s mother.
He urged her to wait in patience, as Sylvia was known
to be in Belgium, and all inquiries were being
instituted.</p>

<p>Afterwards he lunched at the Taverne Joseph, close
to the Bourse, and later was compelled to take train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
back to Dinant, leaving the further inquiries in the
hands of the Brussels police.</p>

<p>That evening, with faint heart, he returned to the
wireless office at the aerodrome and tried to continue
his work, tuning up the wireless set ready for the official
tests. But it was in vain. He was, very naturally,
thinking more of Sylvia than of the elaborate and
highly-efficient apparatus under his care, notwithstanding
the fact that it represented the latest development
of the Marconi Company&#8217;s system of instant communication,
and was, therefore, of special interest.</p>

<p>Next day was Tuesday. At first he resolved not to
keep his appointment with Mademoiselle Levie, who
was to take him to see Monsieur Marvaut at his country
house on the Semois. Yet Marvaut was the director
of the civil aviation, and it was his duty to the Company
to see him, if only for an hour. He had told Monsieur
Guiette this, and promised to be back in Bouvignes
for the test next morning, so that he could be rung up
from Brussels.</p>

<p>Torn by stress of apprehension he managed to control
himself sufficiently to meet Mademoiselle Odille when
about seven o&#8217;clock in the evening she drove up before
the Tête d&#8217;Or, in Dinant to keep her appointment.
The thin-faced watcher was again driving. Meeting
Geoffrey she laughed merrily, and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Could we have a more glorious evening? It
has been perfect ever since we left Brussels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come in for a moment, mademoiselle?&#8221;
Falconer asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thanks. We&#8217;re late now,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
promised monsieur to get you to the château before
dark. Come, get in.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Falconer got in beside her, and a few moments
later they were speeding along the narrow, old-world
streets of Dinant, past the tall Roche-à-Bayard, a
rock in the riverside road, and on through the charming
little village of Anseremme. Then by the winding
road through beautiful country they went by way of
Malvoisin and Monceau, down into the Semois valley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
one of the most picturesque spots in southern Belgium,
that country now remote and still undisturbed as it
was before the Hun invader swept through it with
fire and sword on his way to Brussels.</p>

<p>They had left the river and passed through a great
dark forest when, in the falling darkness, the young
man who drove the car&mdash;the same person who had
watched Geoffrey in the Café Métropole&mdash;suddenly
turned into a well-kept side road which led to a large
country mansion, the Château de Rochehaut.</p>

<p>The door stood open as they pulled up, and on
alighting, mademoiselle conducted him through a
large but well-lit entrance-hall, upstairs to a small,
well-furnished room on the first floor, where she left
him, saying that she would go and fetch Monsieur
Marvaut. The heavy curtains of purple silk damask
were drawn, and the place presented a more cosy aspect
than is usual in Belgian houses.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door reopened and Geoffrey stood
amazed, for he met Sylvia face to face!</p>

<p>Both uttered exclamations of intense surprise, and
both asked questions at the same moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;How came you here, dear?&#8221; asked Falconer
eagerly. &#8220;Why, the police are hunting for you
everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; exclaimed a big, thick-set man who had
followed the girl into the room, and was grinning evilly.
&#8220;And the police will never find either of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you&mdash;and what do you mean?&#8221; Geoffrey
demanded quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean what I say!&#8221; was the man&#8217;s defiant reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have met you somewhere before,&#8221; remarked
Falconer much puzzled, while the girl, who seemed
half dead with fright, clung to her lover&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the fellow&#8217;s response; &#8220;we met at the
Castle of Zenta, in Hungary, where not only did you
escape, but you were the means of sending our brave
leader, Franz Haynald, and Koblitz and Françoise
to prison. I have come from Hungary in order to carry
out what has been decided in consequence.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>&#8220;And what is that, pray?&#8221; inquired Falconer.</p>

<p>&#8220;We succeeded in bringing your <i>fiancée</i> here so that
you may both share the same fate&mdash;<i>death</i>!&#8221; he said
in a low, hard voice, his eyes full of the fierce fire of
vengeance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand aside!&#8221; shouted Geoffrey. &#8220;Let us pass!&#8221;</p>

<p>A second later the young engineer found himself
cornered with a heavy automatic pistol.</p>

<p>&#8220;Move, and I&#8217;ll fire!&#8221; hissed the man whom he
now recognised as a revolutionist named Stadler, who
had visited the pseudo-Baron at the great castle in
the Carpathians.</p>

<p>Then swift as lightning the fellow slipped out of the
door, banged it after him, and ere Geoffrey could reach
it, he had bolted it on the outside.</p>

<p>Both realised that they were caught like rats in a
trap.</p>

<p>Geoffrey in an instant dashed to the window, only,
however, to find to his dismay that it was closely
shuttered and barred from the outside. Precautions
had been taken to prevent their escape!</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; cried the fellow from the other side of the
door, &#8220;let the police search! They will never find
either of you now. You see the stove? Go across&mdash;and
open it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They both glanced across the room and noticed a
round iron stove about five feet in height, used for
burning charcoal in winter.</p>

<p>Falconer crossed, and on opening it, saw within what
seemed to be a steel cylinder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen it&mdash;eh?&#8221; asked the voice mockingly.
&#8220;That cylinder contains poison-gas! I will give you
two minutes before I turn on your lethal draught&mdash;two
minutes to wish each other a long farewell,&#8221; and
the brute laughed heartily in his fiendish triumph.</p>

<p>Sylvia gave vent to a loud piercing shriek when she
realised the horrible fate in store for them, and then
she fell fainting into her lover&#8217;s arms. He bent and
pressed his lips to hers for a second. Afterwards he
placed her in a chair, and taking up another and heavier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
chair, began to attack the door furiously, smashing
the chair in his efforts.</p>

<p>&#8220;The two minutes are up!&#8221; cried that mocking
voice with a low, exultant laugh. &#8220;Good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>Next second a loud hissing came from the stove as
the deadly gas, released suddenly, filled the room.
Geoffrey caught a whiff of it, and instantly sank to
the ground, inert and unconscious.</p>

<p>When they recovered consciousness they both found
themselves in hospital wards, attended by doctors,
and both learned later that it was Sylvia&#8217;s shriek which
saved them.</p>

<p>Monsieur Guiette had fortunately suspected that
Sylvia had met with foul play, and wondering whether
some mishap might not occur to Geoffrey, had ordered
his men to keep strict observation, unknown to the
young Englishman, with the result that in the very
nick of time they had been able to rescue both of them
from that fatal room, and unearth a desperate and
widespread plot. They also arrested the dangerous
Hungarian revolutionist, Hermann Stadler&mdash;who had
rented the château furnished&mdash;as well as the young
motor driver, and the pretty girl, Stadler&#8217;s niece, who
had so cleverly posed as the secretary to the Director
of Civil Aviation. In a wood at the back of the château
they found in a secluded spot an open grave ready for
the reception of the victims!</p>

<p>The wireless tests at Bouvignes were delayed for
two days until Falconer recovered, but at them
Monsieur Marvaut&mdash;who had just returned from
France&mdash;was present, and all went off most satisfactorily,
the results being declared to be greatly to the
credit of Geoffrey Falconer.</p>

<small>THE THREE BAD MEN</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey Falconer,</span> Mrs. Beverley, and Sylvia were
spending a week-end at Tansor, in Northamptonshire,
with George Barclay, a friend of the South American
widow, who rented a hunting-box and rode regularly
with the Fitzwilliam Hounds.</p>

<p>On the night of their arrival when they sat down to
dinner with Barclay and his go-ahead wife and the
latter&#8217;s cousin, a pretty girl named May Farncombe,
all were full of expectation of some good runs. To
Geoffrey, who had recently returned from a mission
abroad, the fine English country house, with its old-world
atmosphere, its old oak, old silver, and air of
solidity, was delightful after the flimsy gimcracks of
foreign life. The young radio-engineer had earned
praise from Marconi House for the manner in which
certain missions abroad had been carried out, and he
was rapidly advancing in the world of wireless.</p>

<p>That evening proved an extremely pleasant one,
and both Geoffrey and Sylvia were attracted by the
chic of May Farncombe, who was tall and dark, about
twenty-two or so, with a remarkable figure shown to
advantage by a smart dinner-frock. She talked well,
sang well, and was most enthusiastic over hunting.</p>

<p>The meet next morning was at Wansford, that
one-time hunting centre beside the River Nene, and
as Geoffrey rode with Sylvia and May, he noticed what
a splendid horsewoman was the latter. She rode astride,
her dark hair coiled tightly, her bowler hat with its
broad brim suited her face admirably, while her habit
fitted as though it had been moulded to her figure.
Tied in her mare&#8217;s tail was a tiny piece of red silk, a
warning that she was a kicker.</p>

<p>Hounds met opposite the Haycock, once a coaching-inn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
but now a private house, and the gathering became
a large one. From the great rambling old house servants
carried glasses of sloe gin for all and sundry who cared
to partake of the old English hunting hospitality.
Geoffrey&#8217;s host introduced him to the Master, while
the crowd of horses and cars became more congested
every minute, and everywhere greetings were being
exchanged.</p>

<p>Presently Barnard, the huntsman, drew his hounds
together, the word was given, and all went leisurely
up to draw first cover.</p>

<p>The morning was a damp cold one in mid-February;
the frost had given, and every one expected a good run
for the scent would be excellent.</p>

<p>The first cover was, however, drawn blank, but
from the second a fox went away straight for Elton,
and soon the pace became fast and furious. After a
couple of miles more than half the field were left behind;
still Geoffrey kept on, and while Sylvia remained far
behind, yet May Farncombe was considerably in front
of him. Suddenly, without any effort, the girl took a
high hedge, and was cutting across the pastures ere he
was aware that she had left the road. That she was
a straight rider was quickly apparent, but Geoffrey
preferred the gate to the hedge and ditch which she
had taken so clearly.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the kill took place near Haddon,
and of the half-dozen in at the death May Farncombe
was one.</p>

<p>When Geoffrey came up five minutes later, she rode
forward, crying:</p>

<p>&#8220;What a topping run, Mr. Falconer! I have enjoyed
it thoroughly!&#8221; Her face was flushed with hard
riding, yet her hair was in no way awry, and she presented
a really fine figure of the up-to-date athletic
girl.</p>

<p>Just, however, as Geoffrey and his companion sat
watching Barnard cut off the brush, a tall, rather
good-looking, fair-haired man rode up, having apparently
been left behind, as he had. As he approached, Geoffrey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
noticed that he gave his handsome companion a strange
look almost of warning, while she, on her part, turned
away her head. It was as though he had made her
some secret sign which she had understood.</p>

<p>That May Farncombe knew him was apparent.
The slight quiver in the man&#8217;s eyelids, and the almost
imperceptible curl of the lips had not passed him
unnoticed. There was some secret between them,
of what nature he, of course, knew not.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder who that man is?&#8221; Geoffrey remarked
quite casually, as soon as he was out of hearing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; was her prompt reply. &#8220;He&#8217;s
often out with the hounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Falconer smiled within himself. He saw that she
did not intend to admit that she had any knowledge
of him. Like all women, she was a clever diplomat.
But the man had made a sign to her&mdash;a sign of secrecy.</p>

<p>And at that moment Sylvia rode up with their host,
George Barclay, and joined them, crying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! what a run! I was left quite out of it.
You were both at the kill, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>That night Geoffrey sat alone with his host after
the others had retired, and from him learnt that Mr.
Farncombe, his wife&#8217;s uncle, had lived a long time in
Marseilles as agent of a great English shipping company,
and that May had been born in France. Falconer
then mentioned the stranger who had exchanged those
meaning glances with the girl, to which Barclay replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I often see the fellow hunting. He comes from
London, and stays at the George, at Stamford, I have
heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>The days passed. Geoffrey managed to obtain an
extension of his leave, and with Sylvia and May went
to several meets&mdash;at King&#8217;s Cliffe, at Laxton Park,
and also at Castor Hanglands. On each occasion
the stranger from London was there. His name,
Geoffrey found out from the George, at Stamford, was
Ralph Phillips, but who or what he was nobody knew.
So long as he paid a generous subscription to the
Fitzwilliam pack, nobody cared.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>That May Farncombe in denying all knowledge of
the man had deliberately told an untruth, was quite
plain. Geoffrey, however, kept his own counsel,
and while spending many happy hours with Sylvia&mdash;Lord
Hendlewycke being away at Cannes staying
with an aunt&mdash;he nevertheless made no mention of
his discovery.</p>

<p>How far Geoffrey was justified in watching the
girl&#8217;s movements is no concern of the writer. But
he did so, for he had unexpectedly alighted upon certain
suspicions, and was determined to elucidate them.</p>

<p>Late one afternoon, Mrs. Beverley and her daughter
having gone with Mrs. Barclay to make a call at Burghley,
Geoffrey went for a stroll alone. While passing along
the footpath from Tansor to Fotheringhay, he was
skirting the edge of a big wood, when he caught sight
of a flash of red among the bare black trees. It was
May Farncombe.</p>

<p>He drew back instantly and watched. She was
standing with the mysterious Mr. Phillips, who was
speaking in a low, earnest tone. He seemed to be
giving her directions, while she appeared to be remonstrating
with him in an appealing attitude.</p>

<p>Fearing discovery, the young radio-engineer turned,
and treading softly over the dead leaves&mdash;which were
fortunately wet&mdash;crept away.</p>

<p>He met her next at the dinner-table, when he noticed
how pale and anxious she was, apparently entirely
changed from her usual light-hearted self. She, of
course, said nothing of the clandestine meeting, but
made pretence of being interested in wireless, asking
him many questions concerning its present development
and its possibilities.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are many fresh discoveries being made?&#8221; she
presently inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Discoveries!&#8221; echoed Sylvia. &#8220;Why, Geoffrey
and his friends are making marvellous discoveries and
improvements every day. But he won&#8217;t tell you
anything, my dear,&#8221; she added; &#8220;so it&#8217;s no use asking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could tell you a good deal,&#8221; Falconer said laughing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
&#8220;only I&#8217;m not allowed. The patents of many of our
fresh discoveries are not yet quite safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! then I understand,&#8221; said the dark-haired
girl at his side. &#8220;But wireless is such a bewildering
puzzle,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Somebody was telling me the
other day some most extraordinary things&mdash;that a
ship, for instance, could be guided through a tortuous
channel by means of a cable laid in the channel, and
that on the way they could actually signal through the
water to the end of the cable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey smiled, and asked who had told her.</p>

<p>She tried to recollect. It was at a dance in London&mdash;a
man she met who was connected with some wireless
firm. She had forgotten his name. She had danced
with him twice, and had then seen no more of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Miss Farncombe, you will be a little surprised
to hear that system you speak of was invented no less
than twenty years ago! It depends on a simple principle
well known to scientists, but has been of no
practical use until comparatively recently, when the
wonderful Thermionic Valve enabled us to enormously
increase the sensitiveness of the apparatus. The
Americans got some kudos in connection with the laying
of a &#8216;leader&#8217; cable, as it is called, at the entrance to
New York Harbour recently, but it is not generally
known that we had the system working over here
during the war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Geoffrey,&#8221; laughed Sylvia, &#8220;it all seems so
simple to you, no doubt, but to me it is wonderful.
I am glad to hear the British were not so behind as so
many would have us believe. You are such a modest
old thing&mdash;I feel sure you had something to do with the
development of this invention. Come, tell me now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! really nothing at all, Sylvia,&#8221; he replied,
&#8220;except perhaps to design an amplifier which was
used with the first leader cable at&mdash;well, one of our
naval bases.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; said the girl whom he loved so dearly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how about the long-distance telephone?&#8221;
asked May Farncombe.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>&#8220;What do you know about such a telephone?&#8221;
Geoffrey asked in surprise, as the girl had referred to a
technical point which only a man versed in wireless
could understand.</p>

<p>For a few seconds the girl seemed rather confused.
Then she said in a rather faltering voice, as she took
up her wine-glass: &#8220;Oh! I don&#8217;t know anything about
wireless, you know. Somebody told me of some
wonderful results in telephoning over long distances.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those words caused Geoffrey Falconer to ponder.</p>

<p>He dropped the subject. Loyal as he was to the
great Marconi Company, he refused to discuss any
of its confidences over a dinner-table. And he was
relieved when the general chatter became concerned
with a dance which was to be given at Peterborough
on the following evening.</p>

<p>Next morning, about eleven o&#8217;clock, Sylvia and
Geoffrey went out for a walk together on the high
road which leads into the quiet little town of Oundle.
Sylvia in a thick grey coat and a canary-coloured
scarf, and carrying a stiff ash stick, went along with
true golfing stride.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, she was the first to mention the
girl Farncombe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t fathom May at all,&#8221; she said. &#8220;To me
she&#8217;s a mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked her lover, pretending ignorance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but she knows so little of you&mdash;and
yet she knows so much!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;her knowledge of wireless last night was
extraordinary. She seems to know things that are
entirely confidential. How? I don&#8217;t like such people,
Geoff. They&#8217;re a bit uncanny!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;She&#8217;s somewhat of a mystery.
But when one goes to a house-party one is sure to meet
people who are mysterious. Yet they may be, after
all, the most ordinary persons. It is one&#8217;s own point
of view that often creates mystery. That&#8217;s my
opinion.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>With that Sylvia agreed. Yet, of course, her lover
had become more than ever puzzled over their fellow-guest,
and was glad when Sylvia let the subject
drop.</p>

<p>Sylvia and he were lovers, it was true, but he was
so plain, straightforward, and honest, that he could
not bring himself to reveal to the girl he loved the facts
which had come within his knowledge.</p>

<p>If May Farncombe had a secret lover, what business
was it of his? True, her undue knowledge of wireless
inventions was somewhat strange, but what was most
probable was that some friend of hers, perhaps the
fair-haired man who had met her clandestinely, had
given her just a little superficial knowledge&mdash;just as
so many people possess.</p>

<p>Geoffrey bade farewell to his host and hostess three
days later, and left for Warley, Mrs. Beverley and her
daughter remaining for a few days longer. Sylvia had
become very friendly with May, and Mrs. Beverley
had asked her to stay with them for a fortnight or
so in Upper Brook Street in about a month&#8217;s time.</p>

<p>Back at the Works at Chelmsford, Geoffrey continued
his research work, assisting two well-known engineers
in some highly interesting experiments. Privately
he was experimenting with the amplification and
magnification of wireless signals as applied to a new
automatic call-device for use at sea. One had recently
been perfected by young Falconer privately, but at
present it was a secret, and not yet patented, for a
slight point about it was not to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>Each night at his own private experimental laboratory
at Warley he spent hours upon hours in trying to
devise some means of removing the one slight defect
of his new apparatus. Several automatic call-devices
had been invented, and the Marconi one for use on
ships had proved extremely satisfactory. Yet Falconer,
true experimenter that he was, was never satisfied
with results. He always endeavoured to make further
improvements.</p>

<p>The calling-device, it may here be explained, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
piece of apparatus which will only ring an alarm bell
when the call-signal of a ship&mdash;three or four letters
of the alphabet&mdash;or the distress signal, &#8220;S.O.S.&#8221; is
sent, and even then it is so arranged that the letters
to which it is set to respond must be repeated before
the alarm rings. The object of such a device is to
enable small ships to work with one operator, who
need not keep constant watch. As a rule passenger
boats of any size carry three operators, who keep
constant watch for calls day and night. But Geoffrey
hoped that, by an improvement of the new device, a
greater perfection still could be arrived at.</p>

<p>His hope, indeed, was to so devise a scheme that any
message sent out to the call-signal to which it was
set, would be printed in Morse automatically upon a
tape instrument, so that even if the operator were
not within call, the message would be recorded. Such
achievement, however, was fraught with many technical
difficulties of wave-length and other things, as all
wireless men will quickly foresee. Still he worked hard
and patiently each evening after his return from the
Works.</p>

<p>Now and then he went to London and spent the
evening in Upper Brook Street. Once or twice he
dined out with Sylvia and her mother, and went to
one or two dances in Mayfair, but the greater part of
his spare time was occupied with his wireless calling-device.
His superiors at Marconi House knew the
trend of his experiments, and encouraged him, for
Marconi apparatus is always being developed, improved,
and again improved, until absolute perfection is at last
arrived at. The calling-device in use was perfect, but
if the incoming message could be recorded, then the
improvement would be of immense benefit to both
shipowners and shipmasters.</p>

<p>One day when he called at Mrs. Beverley&#8217;s, he found
that May Farncombe had arrived upon her promised
visit, and he sat in the drawing-room chatting for a
long time with Sylvia and her friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Geoffrey has actually torn himself away from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
horrible old wireless,&#8221; Sylvia remarked. &#8220;For nearly
a fortnight we&#8217;ve hardly seen him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been awfully busy on a new gadget,&#8221; the
young man replied with a laugh. Then, turning to
May, he added: &#8220;Sylvia is always poking fun at me
because I happen to be enthusiastic over my work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t mean anything, my dear old boy,&#8221;
laughed the girl. &#8220;You know that. What I think
is that you apply yourself far too closely to it&mdash;at
the Works all day and then continuing your work at
home, sometimes into the early hours. You&#8217;ll injure
your health if you don&#8217;t take care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you particularly interested in discovering
just now?&#8221; asked May.</p>

<p>In reply he explained, and found that she listened
quite intelligently.</p>

<p>After an early dinner he took them both out to a
theatre, but was unable to see them home, having to
leave before the performance was over in order to
catch the last train.</p>

<p>As he came out of the theatre a man in evening dress
was standing upon the step, leisurely smoking a cigarette
as though waiting for some one. As Geoffrey brushed
past him, he glanced round, and was surprised to recognise
in him the mysterious stranger of the hunting-field&mdash;the
man known at the George, at Stamford, as Mr.
Ralph Phillips. An omnibus going direct to Liverpool
Street was passing at the moment, and Geoffrey jumped
upon it.</p>

<p>The encounter was a strange one. Was it by mere
accident that they had met? Or was the man Phillips
awaiting May Farncombe? The incident sorely puzzled
him. The pair might be lovers in secret, but their
attitude when he had found them together certainly
negatived such a supposition.</p>

<p>Back at Warley that night Geoffrey found that his
father had gone to bed, so he sat in his wireless
room for a long time trying some new adjustments
upon the piece of apparatus he was bent upon
improving. But recollections of the man Phillips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
kept running through his brain, so that at last he went
to a drawer, and taking out some small snapshot photographs,
selected one which he carried to the light and
carefully examined. It was a photograph of Phillips
which he had taken surreptitiously in the hunting-field.
The man in hunting pink had dismounted and
was leading his horse, while close beside him May
Farncombe could be seen mounted, chatting with Sylvia,
who was riding at her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder?&#8221; he muttered to himself. &#8220;I wonder
what it all means? Why does he haunt the girl so?
Why do they in public appear as strangers? I
wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>And he placed the photograph in his wallet, and
turning out the lights, ascended to his room.</p>

<p>About ten days went by, when one evening, being
in London with Maurice Peterson, one of the engineers
from the Works, they looked in at the Palace Theatre
after dinner. The performance was excellent, as
usual, and later when they strolled into the bar the
first person they encountered was the mysterious
Phillips, well-dressed, and wearing a smartly-cut
grey overcoat.</p>

<p>In a moment Peterson greeted him warmly, and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Falconer, let me introduce you to my friend,
Mr. Paget.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men shook hands. Paget! Then Phillips
was not the man&#8217;s real name, Geoffrey thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we met in Northamptonshire&mdash;didn&#8217;t
we?&#8221; asked the man who called himself Paget.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve met before&mdash;eh?&#8221; asked Peterson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; in the hunting-field,&#8221; Falconer said vaguely,
and then all three had drinks together, and Falconer
and his friend were afterwards compelled to leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is that man Paget?&#8221; Geoffrey asked as soon
as they were in the taxi.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, quite a nice fellow. I met him one day in
the train as I was coming back from Carnarvon. He
seemed to know something about wireless, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
gave me his card. So we met once or twice afterwards.
He has rooms in Half Moon Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s fond of hunting,&#8221; Falconer said. &#8220;Have
you ever seen him with a tall, dark, very good-looking
girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A girl with a mole on her left cheek? Oh, yes.
One afternoon about a week ago I called on him and
found her having tea at his rooms. I didn&#8217;t catch her
name. She was dressed in brown, and had a beautiful
set of furs.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was May Farncombe!</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the young lady. She&#8217;s a friend of mine,&#8221;
Falconer said briefly, more puzzled than ever. &#8220;But
do you really know anything about Paget?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only that he seems to be a man of considerable
means, very generous, and quite a good sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey remained silent. He was thinking deeply.
It seemed that May Farncombe&#8217;s knowledge of wireless&mdash;and
she quite unconsciously had betrayed a fairly
wide grasp of the science and its latest developments&mdash;had
been derived from the man whom she had
pretended was a stranger to her.</p>

<p>Paget&#8217;s attitude towards Geoffrey&#8217;s friend had been
most affable. He had even called him by his Christian
name, and had reminded him of an appointment for
dinner two days later.</p>

<p>Before they left the stranger added: &#8220;I hope,
Mr. Falconer, that we shall meet again very soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>They did meet, and once under rather curious
circumstances.</p>

<p>Geoffrey each night worked hard at his new design
for the calling-device, to which he was attaching
apparatus to record upon the tape the signals received.
He met with failure after failure until at last, one
night, he set his calling-device to receive signals from
the efficient station of a Dutch amateur at Amsterdam&mdash;known
in the world of wireless as &#8220;P.Y.N.&#8221; In
wireless both in America and England, people and
places are known by their call-signal, rather than by
their names. He knew that on that particular evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
&#8220;P.Y.N.&#8221; would call by Morse before sending telephony
and music to English amateurs.</p>

<p>So having set his instrument attached to the &#8220;inker,&#8221;
he waited. Suddenly at nine o&#8217;clock the Morse sounder
gave two or three sharp clicks. He switched on the
tape, and out upon it came a printed message from
Amsterdam to certain stations in England.</p>

<p>His invention was complete!</p>

<p>With natural pride and excitement he called the
Professor, and the pair stood watching the narrow green
tape roll forth from the square brass &#8220;recorder&#8221;
mounted upon its mahogany base&mdash;the strip bearing
the message clearly printed. The calling-device had
only responded to the one signal, &#8220;P.Y.N.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Congratulations, my boy,&#8221; said the old man,
well pleased. &#8220;You deserve success after all that
experimenting and the many hours you have given
to it. I only hope it will bring you advancement and
money,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It certainly should.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; laughed the young man. &#8220;I was told
at Marconi House only the other day that if I were
successful the invention would be of inestimable value.
And now it really works!&#8221;</p>

<p>Next day when he arrived at Chelmsford he told
Peterson of his success, and that morning in the large,
well-appointed luncheon-room at the Works&mdash;that
bright apartment wherein the heads of the departments
take their midday meal, and gossip&mdash;young Falconer
was the recipient of many congratulations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you&#8217;ll patent it at once,&#8221; said one engineer
seated next to him&mdash;a man whose name is a household
word in wireless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; laughed Geoffrey. &#8220;I suppose I ought to
do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ought to? Why, of course. It is a wonderful
advance in wireless,&#8221; said another man a little further
down the table.</p>

<p>That night he was again at Upper Brook Street,
and naturally told Sylvia and her friend of his great
achievement.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>May Farncombe instantly grew interested, and put
to him a number of questions. More than ever the
clever girl showed a remarkable intelligence concerning
wireless.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beverley had a small party that night; therefore,
there was dancing, and the evening was most
enjoyable. &#8220;The Wild Widow&#8221; had been a great
social success in London, and to her parties flocked
the people of the very best set. The penurious Lord
Hendlewycke had fallen beneath a cloud, much to
Sylvia&#8217;s delight, and now her mother seemed keenly
on the alert for some rather better match for her daughter&mdash;with
a man of title, of course. She desired at all
hazards to return to Buenos Ayres as the mother-in-law
of an English peer.</p>

<p>Geoffrey looked on amusedly at it all. With Sylvia
he had a perfect understanding. She had promised
him, time after time, that if she ever married he was
to be her husband. The rest did not matter. Hence
he remained perfectly content, devoting his days&mdash;and
his nights&mdash;to scientific research.</p>

<p>One day Peterson told him that he was dining with
Paget that night at the Bath Club, and that his host
had telephoned asking him to bring him along. At
first Geoffrey hesitated. Next moment he saw that
if he became friendly with the mysterious fox-hunter
he might learn the truth concerning certain facts which
had so sorely puzzled him.</p>

<p>Therefore he accepted.</p>

<p>He found Paget a most genial host. While at table
they spoke of wireless, and Peterson made mention
of his fellow-guest&#8217;s important invention. At once
Paget became interested, but Geoffrey merely laughed,
and with his usual modesty, turned the conversation
into another channel. Afterwards they went to a
theatre and concluded a merry evening.</p>

<p>May Farncombe&#8217;s stay with Mrs. Beverley was almost
at an end. She was joining her aunt in Paris, and
then going with her down to Cap Martin. Somehow
Geoffrey could not put it out of his mind that something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
was wrong. There was a secret between the girl and
the affable man known at Stamford as Phillips, and
in Half Moon Street as Paget. As the looker-on sees
most of the game, he resolved to watch at Half Moon
Street. This he did on several afternoons, wondering
whether the girl, escaping from Upper Brook Street
on pretence of shopping, would call there.</p>

<p>On the third afternoon, as he lingered in the vicinity,
very careful to remain out of observation from the
man&#8217;s windows, she came, neatly and quietly dressed,
and, unseen, Geoffrey watched her enter the house
where Paget lived.</p>

<p>She remained nearly an hour and a half, while he
still waited against the Park railings on the other side
of Piccadilly from where he had a clear view of Half
Moon Street. At last she emerged, and gaining Piccadilly,
turned in the direction of Hyde Park Corner.
Noting this, Geoffrey slipped into a passing taxi and
followed, thus getting in front of her unnoticed in the
traffic. At Apsley House he got out, paid the man,
and mingling with the hurrying crowd, walked in
the direction she was coming.</p>

<p>At last, as though quite unexpectedly, they met.
She started as though he were some apparition. For
a moment she seemed too upset to be able to speak.
Indeed, Geoffrey detected that she had been crying,
for her eyes were swollen, and her cheeks showed traces
of tears.</p>

<p>He was about to remark upon it, but refrained.
Evidently her interview with the fellow Paget had
been the reverse of pleasant, and her attitude set him
further wondering. She, of course, had no idea that
he had watched her go to Paget&#8217;s rooms.</p>

<p>He turned and walked with her up Park Lane, amazed
to notice how nervous and unstrung she seemed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been out to a scent shop in Regent Street,&#8221;
she explained. &#8220;Sylvia and her mother have gone to
tea at Lady Burford&#8217;s, and I&#8217;m busy preparing to go
over to Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When do you leave?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>&#8220;About next Wednesday, I think. My aunt is
coming from Bordeaux, and I meet her at the Hôtel
Bristol.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mystery of her interview with Paget, and its
effect upon her, caused him to ponder as he walked to
Upper Brook Street, where he left her at Mrs. Beverley&#8217;s
door, asking her to give a message to Sylvia that he
had been compelled to get back to Warley.</p>

<p>In order to further endeavour to probe the mystery
surrounding the man Paget, Geoffrey next afternoon,
after leaving Marconi House at a quarter past five,
called unexpectedly upon him at his chambers.</p>

<p>Paget, who was seated before the fire in the ease
of a black velvet lounge coat, jumped up, greeted him
warmly, and bade him be seated in the deep cosy
arm-chair opposite, expressing delight that he had
called.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll dine together,&#8221; he said, as he passed him
the cigarette-box. &#8220;Seen Peterson to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I haven&#8217;t been at Chelmsford to-day,&#8221;
Falconer replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I met another of your fellows from the Works
the day before yesterday&mdash;a friend of Peterson. He
tells me that your printing device is most wonderful&mdash;and
there&#8217;s a lot of money in it. I hope you&#8217;ve patented
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; replied the young fellow frankly, &#8220;but
I mean to do so in a day or so&mdash;when I get the circuits
drawn out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your own invention, I take it? Nothing to
do with the Company&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At present&mdash;no. But the Company controls all
wireless patents that are worth anything at all. They
will control mine,&#8221; was Geoffrey&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope yours will bring you in a lot of money.
It certainly must be of the greatest use in the merchant
service, and you are to be heartily congratulated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey turned the conversation to the Fitzwilliam
Hunt, and the several runs in which both had taken
part, hoping that he might mention May Farncombe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
But he refrained. Indeed, he seemed to have no wish
to recall his stay at Stamford. Perhaps it was because
he had suspicion that Geoffrey knew that the name
he had gone under at the George Hotel was not the
one he was now using.</p>

<p>That night they had a pleasant dinner at Jules&#8217;,
but more than ever it became impressed upon Geoffrey&#8217;s
mind that the man had some sinister influence over the
girl, hence her tears on the previous afternoon. There
was a mystery somewhere, but what it was he was
utterly unable to solve. Still, no man could have been
more genial and light-hearted than that man who,
leading a life of luxury, seemed to be surrounded by
many friends.</p>

<p>On the following Tuesday night Falconer was again
at Mrs. Beverley&#8217;s to bid May Farncombe good-bye,
as she was leaving for Paris on the following morning.
At dinner she seemed anxious to get away from London,
and Geoffrey guessed the reason. She longed to extricate
herself from some invisible net which the man Paget
had cast about her. Apparently, for some secret reason,
she was entirely in his power.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Miss Farncombe,&#8221; he said, as they stood
together in the hall just before he departed, &#8220;I wish
you <i>bon voyage</i>, and I hope we shall see you back in
London again very soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment they were alone in the big wide hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I shall pretend to go
to Paris&mdash;but I shall only go as far as Dover. Where
can you see me alone&mdash;in secret&mdash;to-morrow night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anywhere you like,&#8221; he replied, much surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let us say in the lounge of the Hôtel Russell
at eight o&#8217;clock. But not a soul must know!&#8221; she
whispered.</p>

<p>Then aloud she said cheerily, just as Sylvia came
out of the morning-room:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, good-bye, Mr. Falconer, good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>And they shook hands, and a few moments later
he was walking towards Grosvenor Square more than
ever perplexed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>Next evening he was again in London, and in great
anxiety arrived at the hotel in Russell Square where,
passing through the hall, he saw May Farncombe
awaiting him in the lounge. She had on her hat
and coat, and rose to meet him, pale-faced and
anxious.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see I&#8217;m back!&#8221; she said with a faint smile.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t talk here. Somebody may overhear us!
Let us walk around the Square&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>This they did. They walked together slowly four
times round the Square, though the night was very
cold and windy. Neither thought of the weather,
for the girl was too perturbed and excited, and the
man too annoyed and astounded at what she revealed
to him.</p>

<p>The facts which, in desperation she disclosed, staggered
him. He promised to assist her, while she, on her
part, thanked him profusely and revealed certain
extraordinary circumstances which held him dumbfounded
and fiercely angry.</p>

<p>At last they turned back into the hotel, and after
sitting with her in the lounge for some time, he rose,
and gripping her gloved hand, thanked her for her
confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall really go to Paris to-morrow morning,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;But remember all that I have said, and
respect my confidence&mdash;won&#8217;t you, Mr. Falconer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly will, Miss Farncombe. Good-bye.
You have all my sympathy, I assure you. But keep
a stout heart, for I hope in the end all will be well,&#8221;
he said reassuringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But my secret!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave that to me. Good-bye,&#8221; he repeated, and
turning he left her.</p>

<p>A week later Geoffrey received a note from Paget
asking him to dine with him at the Bath Club, an
invitation which he accepted. Another and rather
older man named Owen, to whom he had been introduced
about a fortnight before, dined with them.
Afterwards they went round to Paget&#8217;s rooms for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
hour, and later Geoffrey left by &#8217;bus to catch his train
from Liverpool Street.</p>

<p>He was walking along the platform and about to
enter the train when Owen, accompanied by a tall,
clean-shaven man, came up breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the man!&#8221; Owen cried, pointing to Falconer.
&#8220;I give him into custody for stealing my pocket-book!
He must have stolen it while we were at the
club!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&mdash;what do you mean?&#8221; gasped the young
radio-engineer, turning upon him aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that you have my pocket-book upon you&mdash;a
brown <i>suède</i> one, with sixty pounds in Treasury
notes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s untrue!&#8221; declared Geoffrey. &#8220;I know nothing
of your pocket-book. But look!&#8221; he exclaimed,
utterly confounded. &#8220;A crowd is collecting. Let&#8217;s
go somewhere and argue it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Owen agreed, turning to the detective.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s go back to Mr. Paget&#8217;s rooms, and then you
can take him to the police-station afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey naturally became indignant, but in the
taxi the detective put his hand into the inner pocket
of the young fellow&#8217;s dinner-jacket and drew forth
the missing wallet!</p>

<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; exclaimed the man; &#8220;here is the missing
property&mdash;found upon you! You can&#8217;t make any
excuse, can you?&#8221; Then turning to Owen he said:
&#8220;It&#8217;s very fortunate, sir, that you came to Vine Street
at once&mdash;or he would have thrown the case away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey could not utter a word. He knew that
he was the victim of some foul plot, from which it
seemed impossible to extricate himself.</p>

<p>Back at Half Moon Street, a prisoner in the hands
of the police, he stood with the three men, utterly
dumbfounded. He protested that the wallet must
have been purposely placed in his pocket when he had
taken off his jacket in order to wash his hands. But
all three laughed at this lame explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do you intend to do?&#8221; asked Falconer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>&#8220;To prosecute you for theft,&#8221; answered Owen.
&#8220;And it will be a nice end to your very promising
career as a wireless engineer!&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey bit his lip in dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there no other way out of it?&#8221; he asked in a
low, hard voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Paget, &#8220;there is.&#8221; And he asked
the detective to retire into the next room. Then when
the door was closed, the man Paget exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I propose, Owen, that if this young fellow gives
us the diagrams of his new device for printing automatic
wireless signals from the call-device, that we say nothing
about it. It would only be a <i>quid pro quo</i>&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But he might give us false diagrams,&#8221;
Owen remarked, shaking his head dubiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make him write a statement that the money has
been found upon him, and in order to avoid arrest
and scandal he undertakes to hand over to us to-night
his diagrams, and also his working apparatus. We
will motor down with him to Warley for that purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this course the two men agreed. Therefore
Paget drew up a confession and undertaking which,
under compulsion, Geoffrey signed, rather than be
brought before the magistrates next day.</p>

<p>Afterwards all four descended together and went
out into the street, where the taxi was still awaiting
them.</p>

<p>Just as they were about to enter it Geoffrey slipped
a police whistle from his vest pocket and blew it, when
instantly four constables and a man in plain clothes
closed upon them, and Geoffrey gave all three in charge!
The man who had posed as a detective was one of the
blackmailing gang!</p>

<p>The faces of the trio were a study. Their plot had
been a clever one, but the counterplot which Geoffrey
had laid for them had been complete.</p>

<p>The man Paget and his two friends appeared in due
course at the Old Bailey, and all three returned to
penal servitude, thus freeing poor May Farncombe&mdash;whom
they had compelled to be their accomplice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
They had held her in their power by first compelling
her to sign a confession of theft in a similar manner,
and then holding over her threats of exposure to her
family and her friends.</p>

<p>The plot which the girl revealed to Falconer was a
deeply-laid and cleverly-conceived one in order to
obtain the secret of his invention, which they had
planned to sell to some German firm in New York for
a very considerable sum.</p>

<p>Indeed, Paget had already booked his passage across
the Atlantic, and would have sailed from Liverpool
on the following day had not Geoffrey laid his plans to
entrap the unscrupulous trio.</p>

<p>Needless to say that on the day following their
arrest steps were taken to patent the new device&mdash;which
is now safe from infringement.</p>

<small>THE MYSTERY OF BERENICE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Over</span> the picturesque Welsh mountains the wind blew
fresh, even though the afternoon was a brilliant one
in August.</p>

<p>Outside the great Marconi wireless station high up
at Ceunant, midway between Carnarvon and Llanberis,
Geoffrey stood with Sylvia and her mother, explaining
the huge aerial system with its ten masts, each four
hundred feet high, placed around the cluster of white
buildings comprising the power-house, transmission
rooms, and other departments. The tall masts dwarfed
the buildings beneath them, and both mother and
daughter gazed up at them wonderingly when Falconer
explained that from them messages had actually been
sent through the ether and received clearly at Sydney,
a distance of twelve thousand miles.</p>

<p>They had spent a most interesting afternoon watching
the commercial messages, most of them in code, being
transmitted to Belmar, on the opposite side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Atlantic, and now the car was waiting to take them
back to Carnarvon where they were staying the night
at the Royal Hotel. They had all three travelled down
by the Irish Mail from Euston to Holyhead, arriving
there in the morning, and after breakfast at the hotel
the car had taken them out to Ceunant, where they
had lunched with the engineer-in-charge, and Geoffrey
had afterwards acted as their guide, making full
explanation of all they witnessed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful!&#8221; declared Sylvia as they entered
the car. &#8220;The public speak airily of wireless, yet they
little know to what marvellous perfection it is being
brought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, dear,&#8221; replied the South American widow.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;re awfully obliged to Geoffrey for showing
us the station. It is a privilege accorded to very
few.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; laughed Geoffrey, &#8220;the company certainly
do not encourage the merely curious. Otherwise all
our stations would be overrun with visitors.&#8221;</p>

<p>The drive back through Llanrug to old-world Carnarvon
was delightful, and after tea Sylvia and her
lover took a stroll through the town as far as the great
mediæval fortress which is washed on two sides by the
waters of the Menai Straits and the Seiont. They were
shown the Eagle Tower, where the first Prince of Wales
was born; the Queen&#8217;s Tower, and the other historic
portions of the fine old castle, and then returned to
the hotel to rejoin Mrs. Beverley.</p>

<p>Later on, while they were at dinner, a tall, good-looking,
dark-haired young man entered and glanced
around to find a seat.</p>

<p>Instantly Geoffrey recognised him as Jack Halliday,
an old schoolfellow at Shrewsbury, who was now a
mining engineer, and was rapidly rising in his profession.
The men greeted each other warmly, and on being
introduced to the two ladies, the newcomer was invited
to a vacant seat at their table.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I last met you, Jack, you were just going
out to Peru,&#8221; Geoffrey said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, that was a couple of years ago&mdash;wasn&#8217;t it? I
did some prospecting in the Andes, and was quite
successful,&#8221; replied the young man. &#8220;Now I&#8217;m off
to Egypt for a trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How lovely!&#8221; remarked Sylvia. &#8220;I wish you&#8217;d
go to Egypt, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine will not be a very comfortable journey,&#8221;
said the young man. &#8220;I&#8217;m going prospecting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In search of mines?&#8221; asked Sylvia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. There is believed to be a rich deposit of
gold at a spot a little to the south of the ancient city
of Berenice, on the west coast of the Red Sea, not
far from Cape Ras Benas. I have obtained from the
Egyptian Government a permit to prospect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How extremely interesting!&#8221; remarked Mrs.
Beverley. &#8220;What makes you think that gold is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it appears that after Pharaoh Ptolemy II
founded the port about three centuries before the
Christian era, gold was discovered in considerable
quantities about eight miles off. For several centuries
the mines were worked, until, with the destruction of
the city, they were also obliterated,&#8221; was Halliday&#8217;s
reply. &#8220;Quite recently, however, my friend, Professor
Harte, the well-known Egyptologist, has been exploring
the ruins, and among the hieroglyphic inscriptions
there, he found mention of the mines and of their
richness. Therefore, it is my intention to endeavour
to locate them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you every success, Jack,&#8221; exclaimed Geoffrey.
&#8220;You certainly deserve it, for you&#8217;re always on the
move.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you meet with a good many adventures when
you are on prospecting expeditions, I suppose?&#8221;
remarked the widow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;a few,&#8221; he answered modestly. &#8220;It is a
pretty rough life sometimes, but one gets used to it,&#8221;
and his bronzed face relaxed into a merry smile.</p>

<p>The party spent an enjoyable evening together, and
while Geoffrey gossiped with the rich widow, his
friend Jack had a long chat with Sylvia.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>They all retired to bed early, and were up betimes to
the usual country hotel bacon-and-egg breakfast, the
habit from which the Englishman, however cosmopolitan,
can never break himself. In northern Europe
they eat cheese for breakfast, in the south the horse-shaped
roll with coffee, but the Briton must ever have
his eggs-and-bacon in no matter what climate.</p>

<p>On arrival at Euston that evening they parted, and
Geoffrey went back to his work in the research department
at Chelmsford. He was experimenting with
the four-electrode valve, the latest and most scientific
invention applied to wireless reception.</p>

<p>Hour after hour, and day after day, with his
telephones clamped over his ears, he experimented
with new circuits, new inductances, and new condensers,
the main object being the application of wireless telephony
to commercial and household requirements in
opposition to the heavy cost of construction and
maintenance of land lines.</p>

<p>Many of the experiments in that great, well-lit room
had given marvellous results, which when made
public, would cause amazement throughout the
world.</p>

<p>One afternoon, ten days later, Geoffrey met Jack
Halliday in London. The latter was busy preparing
his outfit for the expedition to recover the mine of
the ancient Egyptians. Falconer was walking along
the Strand not far from Marconi House when they
accidentally came face to face. With Halliday was a
man of about forty, smartly-groomed and well-set-up,
apparently an ex-officer, with a well-dressed and rather
pretty young woman. The man&#8217;s name was Gilbert
Farrer, and the girl&#8217;s Miss Beryl Hessleton.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just going along to the Carlton to tea,&#8221;
Jack said. &#8220;Come with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey accepted the invitation, and they all took
tea in the palm-court.</p>

<p>Farrer struck Geoffrey as quite a good fellow&mdash;a
man who had knocked about the world a good deal,
no doubt. His companion seemed a smart, go-ahead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
woman, who smoked her after-tea cigarette in a long
amber holder, and seemed to thoroughly enjoy it.</p>

<p>It was soon apparent from the conversation that they
were new acquaintances of Jack&#8217;s. He had met Miss
Hessleton on a steamer between Bergen and Hull a
few weeks before, and they had met again by chance
at Ciro&#8217;s. Then she had introduced him to her friend,
Farrer.</p>

<p>After tea, while the orchestra played softly, the
conversation naturally turned upon Jack&#8217;s expedition,
for he had mentioned it to Beryl Hessleton on the
trip across the North Sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Farrer, &#8220;I wish you every good luck
on your venture. There&#8217;s no doubt that there&#8217;s gold
in Egypt&mdash;and a good deal of it. I recollect when I
was at Oxford reading up a lot about the mines of
the ancient Egyptians. The workings have, I
suppose, during the ages, been buried in the desert
sand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Jack. &#8220;The sands are always
shifting, and no doubt when the ancient city was
destroyed and abandoned before the advance of the
enemy, the Egyptians took good care to obliterate
their mines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect you&#8217;ll have some difficulty in finding
it,&#8221; remarked the smart young lady between puffs
of her cigarette. &#8220;Oh! how I wish I were a man, so
that I could travel and prospect. I&#8217;d love it! You&#8217;ve
got nothing to do, Gilbert. Why don&#8217;t you have a
trip out to the Red Sea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; laughed Halliday. &#8220;I fear you would
soon wish yourself back in London.&#8221;</p>

<p>Three evenings later Geoffrey, who had dined at
Mrs. Beverley&#8217;s, walked round to his club to get his
letters before returning home to Warley, when in the
hall he found Jack Halliday. The latter had just
looked in to leave him a note of farewell, as he was
leaving the following day for Egypt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me round to Bevin&#8217;s and have a bit
of supper,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;It&#8217;s my last night in town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
And you can get a train home and on to Chelmsford
early in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chelmsford!&#8221; laughed Geoffrey. &#8220;I can&#8217;t very
well turn up at the Works in a dinner-jacket!&#8221;</p>

<p>But thus pressed, he nevertheless accepted his old
schoolfellow&#8217;s invitation, and went round to Bevin&#8217;s,
the smart night club close to Portman Square.</p>

<p>The scene there was one of gay abandon, of reckless
expenditure, and somewhat questionable morals. Alas!
how the West End has degenerated since the war!
Yet these adventures of Geoffrey Falconer have no
concern with the morals of Underground London.</p>

<p>Beryl Hessleton and Gilbert Farrer were there, and
all four had supper, during which Halliday told them
that he hoped to win a fortune upon the information
which his friend, the famous Egyptologist, had derived
from the ancient monuments in the colossal ruins of
Berenice, some of which were quite as wonderful as
those at Thebes.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I find this mine, I have a first-class firm into
whose hands I can easily place the concession,&#8221; he said
to Falconer across the table, amid all the gay laughter
and irresponsible chatter of the assembled company.
The West End to-day only emulates the Montmartre
of yesterday, with its &#8220;Heaven,&#8221; &#8220;Hell,&#8221; and &#8220;The
Red Windmill,&#8221; without counting the &#8220;Dead Rat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The war has passed, but your cosmopolitan of any
nation is just the same easy-going Bohemian traveller,
a gipsy whose laughing boast is that when his hat is
on his roof is on.</p>

<p>Such a man was Jack Halliday.</p>

<p>Geoffrey next day saw him off from Victoria Station
with an array of green canvas bags&mdash;long bags like
those of cricketers. And with him upon the platform
stood Beryl Hessleton. The young mining engineer
had been pleasant to her, but he was rather surprised
that she should take the trouble to see him off. Geoffrey
noted it, but made no comment.</p>

<p>About six weeks went by. One evening, having
worked late in the research laboratory at Marconi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
House, Geoffrey walked westward to his club. On
the way he met a middle-aged man-about-town named
Franks, whose acquaintance he had formed at Mrs.
Beverley&#8217;s, and after a brief chat, Geoffrey invited him
to dine at the Grill of the Piccadilly Hotel.</p>

<p>While they were eating their meal a stout, white-haired
man entered, accompanied by the handsome
Beryl Hessleton, who, recognising the young radio-engineer,
waved her hand across at him and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hulloa! Do you know her?&#8221; asked Franks with
some surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Slightly,&#8221; was Geoffrey&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; grunted the other. &#8220;A pretty cute crowd
she&#8217;s in with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; inquired Falconer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;well. That old chap she&#8217;s with is old Daddy
Whittaker&mdash;a friend of a fellow named Farrer. The
whole crowd are international crooks, so be careful
if you happen to know them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey was surprised at this. But, as usual, he
kept his own counsel. It seemed that his old school
chum, Jack, had got mixed up with a very queer set.
But in the West End there are queer sets on every hand,
the dancing and drug-taking degenerates of both sexes
who live upon their wits, and live very well, too. In
certain circles within a mile of Piccadilly Circus, thieves
and blackmailing vampires hobnob with young and
pretty women of title, while innocent persons of both
sexes fall into the vortex of vice and gaiety.</p>

<p>Presently Geoffrey asked, glancing across at Beryl:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you really know about her? She&#8217;s
rather fond of a great pal of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I pity your pal, my dear Falconer,&#8221; was the
elderly man&#8217;s reply. Franks was a member of Wells&#8217;
and the Bachelors&#8217;, and he moved in a very fast, go-ahead
set.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked the young radio-engineer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because of the past record of the crowd of which
she is the decoy-duck. That&#8217;s all,&#8221; was his friend&#8217;s
reply. &#8220;Daddy Whittaker, who is sitting yonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
with her, is an old gaol-bird who still directs the
nefarious operations of a dozen men and women. And
woe betide anyone who falls into that girl&#8217;s net.&#8221;</p>

<p>Falconer, full of thought, went on with his dinner.
They were out of hearing of the girl and her companion.
At last the young fellow related how he had
been at Bevin&#8217;s Club with his old schoolfellow, Halliday,
where Beryl and Gilbert Farrer had also been.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all I hope is that your friend Halliday will
keep clear of that unholy organisation,&#8221; said his
companion. &#8220;They&#8217;ll stick at nothing. But why
are they friendly with your old schoolfellow? What
is the motive&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. He&#8217;s a mining engineer, and has
just gone to the Red Sea prospecting for a gold mine
of the ancient Egyptians.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Then he should beware. There&#8217;s no doubt
some very subtle plot afoot. You should warn your
friend to have a care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t get at him. He&#8217;s gone out to Cape Ras
Benas, and, like all prospectors, has not left an
address.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a pity. But when you get in touch with
him again, warn him at once to avoid Daddy and his
crowd as he would a poison bowl. They&#8217;re dangerous&mdash;very
dangerous. I heard from my old friend, Superintendent
Tarrant, of Scotland Yard, all about them.
You recollect the Alleyn scandals in the papers about
nine months ago? Well, old Whittaker and the girl
yonder were at the bottom of it all. They escaped
prosecution for blackmail, but they had netted over
ten thousand pounds out of old Mr. Alleyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Falconer now grew suspicious of Beryl&#8217;s acquaintance
with his chum. Why had she seen him off so
affectionately?</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder where Farrer is to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Farrer! Why, he&#8217;s a bird of passage&mdash;the kind
of man who eats his breakfast in London, dines in
Paris, and lunches next day beyond the Mont Cenis
tunnel. He&#8217;s one of the cleverest thieves in all Europe&mdash;with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Daddy&#8217;s brain, of course, behind him,&#8221; was
Franks&#8217; reply.</p>

<p>Falconer looked across the crowded room to where
the old man and the girl were eating their dinner
together. To others they appeared to be father and
daughter. The man had an evening paper, and
now and then glanced at it when the courses were
finished.</p>

<p>When Geoffrey and Franks rose, the former looked
across and bowed as he went out, full of wonder and
suspicion.</p>

<p>The days that followed proved busy days for Geoffrey.
An entirely new circuit for wireless telephony had
been devised by the well-known radio-expert, Captain
Meredith, at the Works, and it was being tested&mdash;low
voltage on the anode of the valves and a high amperage
on the aerial&mdash;an achievement which had been
attempted for a year with little success. Here, however,
the combined brains of the Marconi <i>personnel</i> were
again persevering towards perfection, and it had fallen
upon Geoffrey to assist in some of the most delicate
and intricate experiments.</p>

<p>Hence he had but little time to go up to London
to see Sylvia.</p>

<p>One day, about three months later, as he sat down
to luncheon in the bright, airy &#8220;officers&#8217; mess&#8221; at the
Works, one of his fellow engineers, named Davies,
seated opposite him, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a big find of gold just made at a mine
worked by the Pharaohs in Egypt. By Jove!&#8221; he
added with a sigh, &#8220;mining seems to be more profitable
than wireless!&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey, pricking up his ears, instantly asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the mine situated?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somewhere on the Red Sea, close to the ruins of
an ancient city&mdash;I forget the name of the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it Berenice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;that&#8217;s the name of the place. How do you
know? I was told in London yesterday, and I was
told in confidence,&#8221; Davies said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>&#8220;By whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By a fellow I know named Farrer. He&#8217;s been out
there and got a concession from the Egyptian Government.
And he&#8217;s no doubt made a fortune. I wish
I were in his shoes!&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey held his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is your friend Farrer a mining engineer?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. He&#8217;s a speculator&mdash;bought the concession
off somebody, I suppose. A lucky speculation.
I met him the night before last at the Palais de Danse.
He had with him a very pretty girl he called Beryl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I suppose you met an old white-haired man
named Whittaker?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;&#8216;Daddy,&#8217; they called him,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;And perhaps you met them at Bevin&#8217;s night
club&mdash;eh?&#8221; asked Falconer.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you know that?&#8221; inquired his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;because I guessed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you also know Farrer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Geoffrey replied briefly, for the conversation
had increased his wonder and suspicion. Along the
table the conversation turned, as it always does, upon
wireless research and the business of the Company,
interspersed with personal chaff. At Chelmsford there
is a daily reunion of heads of departments at luncheon,
where the interchange of ideas is always intellectual,
for gathered there are men of the greatest scientific
knowledge, mostly young, all enthusiastic, and all
experts in their own branches of radio-telegraphy.</p>

<p>Later that day young Falconer went into the testing
department where Davies was busily engaged, and
returned to the conversation they had had at luncheon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Farrer an intimate friend of yours?&#8221; asked
Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not intimate. I know Beryl, his pretty little
friend. I&#8217;ve dined once or twice with him in town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever met a fellow named Jack Halliday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Never heard the name. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, because Halliday, who is an old schoolfellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of mine, is prospecting for gold on the Red Sea
coast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Then no doubt Farrer has bought his secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he&#8217;s stolen it,&#8221; Geoffrey suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; declared his friend. &#8220;Farrer is a real good
fellow, most generous to his friends, and one of the
most upright men I&#8217;ve ever met.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey, reflecting upon what his friend Franks had
told him, became more mystified.</p>

<p>Where was Jack Halliday?</p>

<p>Next day Geoffrey, being in London, called at the
address in Bayswater, which Jack had given him.</p>

<p>The landlady said it was true that he had rooms
there, but she had not seen him since he left for Egypt.
About three weeks ago, however, she received a telegram
from him, and this she produced. It had been dispatched
from Alexandria three weeks before, and asked
Mrs. Gibbons to send through Pickford&#8217;s by <i>grande
vitesse</i> his big black trunk addressed to Cook&#8217;s baggage
department at Marseilles, adding that he was unable to
return to London at present, as he was sailing for Cuba.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you have sent the trunk?&#8221; asked Geoffrey
of the pleasant, round-faced woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;It went on the day after I received the message.
Pickford&#8217;s collected it,&#8221; replied the landlady.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did the trunk contain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! of that I have no idea, except that I think
Mr. Halliday kept most of his business papers in it,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Once it was open in his bedroom, and I
saw in it a lot of papers tied up with pink tape, like
lawyers use.&#8221;</p>

<p>Falconer paused. Why had it been sent to Marseilles
when his friend had these rooms as his <i>pied-à-terre</i>
in London?</p>

<p>They were standing in Jack Halliday&#8217;s little sitting-room
at the time, and he glanced around. Mrs.
Gibbons pointed to one or two souvenirs of travel upon
the walls, and a few curios upon a side-table which she
kept carefully dusted in the eager expectation of her
wandering lodger&#8217;s return.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>Geoffrey Falconer left Bayswater with a distinct
impression that something was radically wrong. He
could not understand why Jack, if he were called from
his prospecting upon the Red Sea coast to go to Cuba,
should have wanted his private papers sent to Cook&#8217;s
at Marseilles&mdash;that great baggage organisation through
which passes half the luggage of those going to India
and the Far East.</p>

<p>That night he spoke to Sylvia, telling her the whole
facts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe with you, Geoff, that something is wrong.
Why should Mr. Farrer, who is not an expert mining
engineer like your friend Halliday, be in possession of
the secret of the Berenice Mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean to make it my business to inquire,&#8221; replied
the young fellow. &#8220;Jack shall not suffer if I can
help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Falconer did not allow the grass to grow beneath
his feet, for next day he was on the alert. The telegram
had been sent by the Eastern Company&#8217;s cable from
Alexandria, but at ten o&#8217;clock that morning he inquired
of S.U.H. (Ras-el-Tin), the radio station at Alexandria,
whether the Englishman, Mr. Halliday, could be found
in that city.</p>

<p>Half an hour later there came back a reply that
inquiry had been made at the chief post-office
at Alexandria, but nobody of that name was
known there.</p>

<p>The next message Falconer sent was to the engineer-in-charge
at Port Sudan, on the Red Sea, south of Cape
Ras Benas, asking him if he had heard anything of
the young mining prospector, Jack Halliday.</p>

<p>The answer by wireless was &#8220;Wait&mdash;wait&mdash;wait:
for two hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey waited. Two hours later Port Sudan replied
that nothing was known of Mr. Halliday, and suggested
that inquiry be made of Cairo. But the high-power
station at Abu Zabal, outside Cairo, later on answered
as follows to the experimental call-signal he had used:</p>

<p>&#8220;2.A.Z. from S.U.S. Reply to your inquiry <i>re</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
mining engineer Halliday, can obtain no knowledge
of him here except that he was at Ras Benas two months
ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night Falconer went up to London, and with
apparent idleness, he lounged into Bevin&#8217;s night club.
The place was crowded, and the supper-room full after
the theatre. It was not, however, long before he espied
the man he sought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hulloa, Farrer!&#8221; he cried in warm welcome, and
a moment later he bent over the hand of his well-dressed
companion, Beryl Hessleton. &#8220;Why, I thought you
were abroad!&#8221; exclaimed Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gilbert got back some time ago,&#8221; replied Beryl.
&#8220;He&#8217;s had a lovely time in Egypt. I only wish I
had been there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the smartly-groomed man in evening
clothes, &#8220;I really had a tophole time in Cairo. And
afterwards I went up the Nile to Assouan. There I
met your friend Halliday. He&#8217;s found that ancient
mine, and I&#8217;ve bought it from him. He&#8217;s gone to
Cuba.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you buy it?&#8221; asked Geoffrey in surprise.
&#8220;Then I suppose Halliday will soon be back in town
again&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so. He&#8217;s been engaged by some
big firm of American mining engineers to prospect
for iron in Cuba, I believe. Anyhow, when we met at
the Cataract Hotel, in Assouan, he was full of it. He
didn&#8217;t seem to think that the mine in Berenice was
worth very much&mdash;worked out centuries ago, he said.
So he sold it to me with the concession&mdash;lock, stock,
and barrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will re-sell it to a company, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps. I don&#8217;t quite know yet. I&#8217;ve one or
two people in the city ready to take it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if the mine is worked out, of what use is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that Halliday really explored it very
much. He found it, but just at the moment he received
the tempting offer from America; so he was glad to
get rid of it. I went over to Ras Benas before I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
bought it, and looked into the hole in the sand which
gave entrance to the ancient workings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you will find that it is still a rich mine.
Gold is sadly wanted now that America holds all that
we had before the war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it,&#8221; said the smartly-dressed man.
&#8220;Old Julius Evenden used that selfsame argument
yesterday when I put the prospect before him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve offered it to Evenden?&#8221; asked
Falconer, naming one of the greatest financial houses
in the city.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I believe he&#8217;ll take it up. If so, it will
mean a fortune for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you always were terribly lucky, Gilbert!&#8221;
laughed Beryl. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go across and have a drink.
I&#8217;m sure Mr. Falconer wants to wish you good-luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the trio passed along to the little bar just off
the dancing-room.</p>

<p>A Marconigram sent from Fenchurch Street to Marseilles
next day by Falconer elicited the fact, from
Cook&#8217;s Agency, that the black trunk received from
London addressed to Mr. Halliday had been claimed
three days after its arrival.</p>

<p>Again Geoffrey inquired by wireless for a description
of the man who had claimed it, but the reply was that
he was &#8220;an elderly Englishman&#8221;!</p>

<p>Though Geoffrey was very full of work, experimenting
upon the new circuit for wireless telephony,
nevertheless he devoted all his spare time to solving
the whereabouts of his old school chum. And in this
Sylvia gladly assisted him.</p>

<p>By constantly spending his evenings amid the gay
crowd at Bevin&#8217;s he was able to watch Gilbert Farrer
pretty closely. He often met the sprightly Beryl,
who was never loth to dance with him, Geoffrey being
an unusually good dancer, and good-looking into the
bargain. So by being on friendly terms with the girl
Falconer was enabled to keep Farrer under observation.</p>

<p>Farrer knew, of course, of Geoffrey&#8217;s friendship
with the mining engineer, but that fact did not concern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
him now that he had purchased his interest in the
re-discovered mine of the Pharaohs.</p>

<p>At Bevin&#8217;s, late one night, Geoffrey had been dancing
with Beryl, Farrer being absent. He had not looked in
all night, and it was already three o&#8217;clock in the morning.
Geoffrey was about to return to his club when a white-haired,
benevolent-looking old gentleman, whom he
at once recognised as &#8220;Daddy&#8221; Whittaker, the notorious
crook, came in and advanced to meet the girl, who,
in turn, introduced him to her companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seen Gilbert to-night?&#8221; asked old Mr. Whittaker
eagerly of Beryl.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I haven&#8217;t seen him all day. He promised
to take me to lunch at the Pall Mall, but he never
turned up&mdash;and he didn&#8217;t &#8216;&#8217;phone&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! he&#8217;s busy,&#8221; replied the old man in a low
voice. &#8220;He fixed up that little matter with Evenden
this afternoon. They are sending out two experts
to Egypt at the end of the week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried the girl. &#8220;The Berenice Mine
sold! Then Gilbert&#8217;s made his fortune! He always
was a lucky fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but he doesn&#8217;t want it known yet,&#8221; the old
fellow went on confidentially. &#8220;So say nothing about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Farrer told me about his purchase of the mine,&#8221;
Geoffrey remarked quite casually. &#8220;It&#8217;s most interesting&mdash;is
it not? My friend, Jack Halliday,
re-discovered it after the secret of its existence had
been lost for two thousand years.&#8221;</p>

<p>At mention of Halliday the white-haired old man
glanced at him quickly, but his manner did not alter
in the least.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I believe Gilbert bought it from a man named
Halliday, together with the concession which he&#8217;s got
from the Egyptian Government. Anyhow this mine
could not be in better hands than those of Evenden.
Of course it may be exhausted. But the experts they
are sending out will soon decide that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In any case a company will be formed to run it, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
suppose?&#8221; asked Beryl, whereupon the crafty old man
smiled knowingly, as he remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;An ancient gold mine always attracts subscribers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two days later Geoffrey Falconer sat in the old-fashioned
room of Mr. Julius Evenden, the world-famous
financier, and made inquiry regarding the
Berenice Gold Mine.</p>

<p>At first the head of the great financial house, whose
dealings were world-wide, was inclined to resent undue
intrusion into his business dealings with Gilbert Farrer,
until the young fellow explained that his old schoolfellow
had, owing to Professor Harte&#8217;s discovery of
the hieroglyphics, gone to the ruins of the ancient
Egyptian city for the purpose of searching for the
long-forgotten mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard Professor Harte&#8217;s name in connection
with the affair,&#8221; said old Mr. Evenden. &#8220;Of course,
he is one of our greatest Egyptologists. Perhaps he
is on the telephone,&#8221; and he rang his bell and gave his
clerk instructions to endeavour to get through to
the Professor.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Mr. Evenden was speaking with
the Professor, who lived at Wimbledon, and urged him,
if possible, to call at Great Winchester Street that
afternoon.</p>

<p>The hour fixed was four o&#8217;clock, and Geoffrey was
present at the interview.</p>

<p>When Mr. Evenden informed the great Egyptologist
that he had purchased all interest in the re-discovered
mine from Gilbert Farrer, he stood amazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely my friend Halliday, to whom I gave a
copy of the inscription upon the ruins of the Temple
of Isis at Berenice, and whom I trust implicitly, would
never have parted with his interest in the mine without
first consulting me!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is the transfer,&#8221; replied Mr. Evenden, handing
the Professor a document. &#8220;It was signed before a
French Notary-Public in Alexandria you will see.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old Professor adjusted his pince-nez, and after
reading the document carefully, examined the signature.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>&#8220;That is forged!&#8221; he declared at once. &#8220;I know
Jack Halliday&#8217;s signature extremely well. I have
some of his most recent letters here,&#8221; and he took
several letters from his pocket. These all three
examined very closely. Some were signed &#8220;Jack,&#8221;
others &#8220;J. Halliday.&#8221; But in no case did the signature
on the document exactly correspond with the signature
on the letters!</p>

<p>&#8220;You see the last letter was dated from Alexandria
six weeks ago, and speaks of his success, and his intention
of coming straight home,&#8221; the Professor remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then where is he now&mdash;and why has his luggage
been sent so urgently to Marseilles and claimed?&#8221;
asked Falconer.</p>

<p>Mr. Evenden thereupon became suspicious, and
related his dealings with Gilbert Farrer, and how he
had already paid him a considerable sum on account,
until the reports of the engineers he was sending to
Egypt should be forthcoming.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no doubt that Halliday has re-discovered
the workings,&#8221; said the Professor. &#8220;But where is he
now! He seems to have mysteriously disappeared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The only man who knows his whereabouts is Gilbert
Farrer,&#8221; declared Geoffrey decisively. &#8220;For what
reason was that trunk containing his private papers
sent so hurriedly to Marseilles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That we must discover,&#8221; declared Mr. Evenden.
&#8220;Our policy must be to act without arousing Farrer&#8217;s
suspicions,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Thereupon the three sat down and evolved a plan.</p>

<p>The first step was taken by Geoffrey, who, through
Beryl, discovered the whereabouts of &#8220;Daddy&#8221;
Whittaker. Next day he met him by appointment
in the Park, and as they were walking together, Sylvia,
who was dressed as a tourist, took a secret snapshot
of them as they passed.</p>

<p>This photograph was quickly developed, and that
same night Falconer left with it for Marseilles.</p>

<p>Two days later he showed it to the employé at Cook&#8217;s
baggage depôt, who at once, and without hesitation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
declared the elder man to be the person who claimed
the trunk addressed to Mr. Halliday. The trunk had
been signed for and taken away on a taxi-cab. The
signature in the book was that of &#8220;J. Halliday.&#8221;
But it certainly was not Jack&#8217;s!</p>

<p>Geoffrey took the <i>rapide</i> back to Paris that night,
sorely puzzled. What had become of his old chum?
Marconigrams were sent broadcast in search of him.
The passenger lists of six ships sailing from Marseilles
to Cuba were examined, but in no case was there any
trace of any such person in the lists.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, as the express halting at
Laroche awakened him, it suddenly crossed his mind
that Jack&#8217;s identity was being obliterated by some
clever combination of the crooks. In Paris he would go
to the Bureau of the Sûreté and make inquiries.</p>

<p>At noon he was in the dull, drab office of the famous
French detective, Gaston Meunier, to whom he told
the story, and asked whether he thought his friend
had met with foul play.</p>

<p>The little bald-headed official raised his shoulders
and replied that, in view of the fact that the trunk
had been sent to Marseilles, it was quite possible
that Monsieur Halliday had returned from Egypt to
France.</p>

<p>Then they went into dates. Afterwards the great
detective rose, and left him. Ten minutes later he
reappeared, having a number of police photographs
of persons who had been found dead, suicides, and
those wilfully murdered, whom the police both in Paris
and in the Departments had failed to identify.</p>

<p>The period covered was six months.</p>

<p>With great eagerness Geoffrey Falconer examined
one after another&mdash;many of them pictures of recovered
bodies, a terrible, gruesome collection&mdash;when at last
he came across the picture of a man lying face upward
on the grass.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Jack!&#8221; he exclaimed wildly. &#8220;I have
no hesitation in identifying him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Monsieur Meunier turned to the back of the large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
unmounted photograph, and read what was written
there as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;An unknown. Supposed to be English. Discovered
at 7.10 a.m., on October 28th, behind a
small pottery factory, a mile from the village of St.
Uze, close to Valence, Department of the Drôme.
The medical examination showed the person to have
died from some vegetable poison. It is believed
that he was deposited at the spot during the night
from a passing car. No arrest has been made. Any
details of identification to be sent to the Prefect
of the Drôme.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Three days later Geoffrey arrived at Charing Cross
accompanied by an agent of the Paris Sûreté, who at
once applied for the arrest and extradition of the
adventurer, Gilbert Farrer.</p>

<p>This took place when Farrer called at Mr. Evenden&#8217;s
office next day&mdash;and two months later, at his trial
before the Assizes of the Seine, the clever assassin
who had stolen poor Jack Halliday&#8217;s secret was
sentenced to penal servitude for life.</p>

<p>At the present moment he is still in the convict
prison at Lyons, while his friend Beryl and &#8220;Daddy&#8221;
Whittaker, who were both deeply implicated in the
plot, were each sentenced to fifteen years&#8217; penal servitude
at the Old Bailey.</p>

<p>The great Berenice Gold Mine is being worked with
huge success, but the profits which should have been
poor Jack&#8217;s are being paid regularly to his widowed
mother, who lives in seclusion in Pembrokeshire, deeply
mourning the loss of one of the finest and bravest
of Englishmen.</p>

<small>THE MARKED MAN</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> military wireless station at Aldershot had just
finished sending the usual extracts from the press to
the headquarters of the Rhine Army at Cologne, when
Geoffrey Falconer, with the telephones still over his
ears, lowered the wave-length of his reception set, and
began to listen to the strains of an orchestra being
played at The Hague.</p>

<p>It was a Sunday afternoon, and &#8220;the Dutch Concert,&#8221;
to which all wireless men in England listen so eagerly,
was in progress.</p>

<p>Seated in his own experimental laboratory at Warley
he leaned his elbows upon the operating-bench and
listened.</p>

<p>Who would have dreamed a couple of years ago that
a concert given at The Hague could be heard with
distinctness by wireless in every corner of the United
Kingdom! A cornet solo at the moment being played
was loud and perfectly clear. He turned a switch,
when from the black trumpet of the loud-speaker telephone
on the table the sound became so amplified that
the instrument could be heard in any part of the house.</p>

<p>During the day he had been engaged upon some
highly interesting experiments upon a crystal producing
oscillations, audible frequency currents being obtained
by two metal electrodes dipped into the powder of a
certain crystal. The matter was extremely technical,
and would not be understood by any but radio experimenters;
therefore, I need not further describe it.
Suffice it to say that all the time Geoffrey could spare
from the Works at Chelmsford he devoted to research
in his own laboratory at home.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beverley and Sylvia were away in the Trossachs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
hence he seldom went to London save when duty took
him up to Marconi House.</p>

<p>Geoffrey listened to several songs from The Hague,
and then put down the head-&#8217;phones, switched his
aerial wires to earth, and went out into the pleasant
old-world garden to smoke a cigarette. The afternoon
was clear and bright, and along the grass path of the
long rose walk he strolled, his mind full of the scientific
problems which he had been endeavouring all the
morning to solve. He wandered to the lawn and sat
down in the summer-house awaiting the Professor,
for always about that hour he, too, came forth from
his study to enjoy a cigar. Suddenly, however, the
housemaid appeared saying that he was wanted on the
hand telephone.</p>

<p>He hastened to the instrument in the hall, when he
found himself speaking to one of his fellow-engineers,
named Jerrold, who lived at Witham, and who had a
private wireless station similar to his own not far from
the Marconi station there.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Falconer,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;have you been
listening lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Till about twenty minutes ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Then you didn&#8217;t hear that message to you&mdash;did
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. What message?&#8221; asked Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, somebody on the wireless &#8217;phone about sixteen
hundred mètres wave-length, called you by name,
Geoffrey Falconer, Warley, Essex, England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. What did he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether it was a man&#8217;s voice or a
woman&#8217;s. If a man&#8217;s it was unusually high-pitched.
The modulation was not very good, though I heard
the words quite distinctly, and wondered if you also
heard them. It was a kind of warning to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Warning!&#8221; echoed the young Marconi engineer.
&#8220;In what way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, whoever was calling you evidently did not
know your call-signal, so called your name. And then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
he went on to warn you <i>not to go East</i>. If you do, you
go at your peril!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to go East! How strange!&#8221; Geoffrey
remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; it&#8217;s a bit uncanny&mdash;isn&#8217;t it? He repeated
it several times, and then added the words: &#8216;Anyone
hearing this urgent message, will they kindly give it
to Geoffrey Falconer at Warley, Essex, England?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some silly ass having a joke,&#8221; laughed Falconer.
&#8220;I heard the other day that some horrible spook
message was given by a practical joker over the radiophone,
and the fellow who heard it, being a spiritualist,
nearly died of fright. Perhaps it&#8217;s the same fellow up
to his tricks again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps. We&#8217;ll listen again for him, and if he
gives any more warnings we&#8217;ll put the direction-finders
on him, and he&#8217;ll very soon have his license taken away&mdash;if
he has one,&#8221; said Jerrold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s curious,&#8221; exclaimed Geoffrey laughing.
&#8220;I wonder why I&#8217;m forbidden to go East, and what
peril is in store for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! that I don&#8217;t know. The message was given
at twenty-eight minutes past three. So we&#8217;ll listen
to-morrow at the same time, and on the same wave-length.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right-o!&#8221; said Falconer, hanging up the receiver
and then strolling back into the garden, wondering
what the message really meant.</p>

<p>He had no intention of going East, save that he had
a week before received instructions to proceed to
Lucerne, where, close by, on the Tomlishorn, the highest
peak of the Pilatus, above Alpnachstad, the Marconi
Company were erecting a one-and-a-half kilowatt
telephone and telegraph set ordered by the Swiss
Government, the set used at the meeting of the League
of Nations at Geneva having proved such a great
success.</p>

<p>Lane, one of the engineers, was already out there,
and he had been ordered to follow him and superintend
the fitting and testing of the station before it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
was handed over to the Swiss authorities. Switzerland
certainly lay to the East, but what mysterious
peril awaited him there was certainly obscure. At
first he grew a trifle anxious in view of his previous
adventures, but later that evening he decided that it
was some amateur who, having learned of his impending
departure, was playing a practical joke. Yet curiously
enough only about three or four people at the Marconi
Works knew of the order he had received.</p>

<p>At dinner that night he mentioned the incident to
the Professor, but both decided that it was only some
silly joke.</p>

<p>On the following Thursday he left Charing Cross
for Lucerne, where, at the Schweizerhof, that well-known
hotel facing the lake, Lane, who had come by
boat from Alpnach, came to meet him. Next day they
ascended to the famous Hôtel Pilatuskulm, where they
took up their quarters, only half an hour&#8217;s walk by a
good path to the site of the new wireless station.</p>

<p>Already the two one-storeyed buildings, and the aerial
upon masts of steel lattice, were erected. The
material had all come out from England, and the
contractors had finished their work on the masts.
Indeed, Lane and his colleagues from Chelmsford had
already commenced their work of fitting the apparatus.</p>

<p>The wireless station which the Swiss Government
had ordered was situated high upon the wild rocky
mountains, and was intended for the communication
of post-office messages with Rome, Vienna, and Paris,
the apparatus being the last word in Marconi invention.</p>

<p>The two great buildings which comprise the hotel
were full to overflowing, as it usually is in the autumn
season, a gay cosmopolitan crowd, who dined and danced
and went on excursions either mountaineering or along
the great blue lake to Kussnacht to see Tell&#8217;s Chapel,
to Vitznau, Brunnen, or Fluelen. From the verandas
there spread a wonderful panorama of lake and mountain
with the various peaks, with the names of which the
visitor so soon becomes familiar.</p>

<p>Geoffrey was standing alone on the veranda early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
one morning admiring the wonderful view in the
morning light. There was passing along a very feeble,
white-haired, white-bearded old man, accompanied
by a handsome dark-haired, well-dressed young woman,
who, from the attention she paid him, was palpably
his daughter. The old fellow walked decrepitly as
one of advanced age, and ever and anon he halted to
take in the wondrous scene.</p>

<p>As they passed by they spoke in a tongue with which
Geoffrey was unfamiliar. But the young woman, he
saw, wore a wedding ring.</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and in hers he noted a strange,
appealing look&mdash;an expression which, being quite
unusual, caused him to ponder. He was rapidly
becoming a cosmopolitan after his various missions
abroad on behalf of the Marconi Company.</p>

<p>All that day he spent in the wireless hut high upon
the bare, rocky mountain, carefully fitting the instruments
which were to give such a wide range of telegraphy
and speech&mdash;the very latest devices that had
been invented in the research department at Chelmsford,
for, after all, the real brains of wireless are centred
in that old-fashioned Essex town.</p>

<p>That night he was back with Lane at the big hotel,
and dined in the great <i>salle à manger</i>, amid the gay
laughter and chatter.</p>

<p>Across in a corner sat the white-bearded old man
with his married daughter. He seemed rather deaf,
for ever and anon she bent to speak with him. And
as she did so, he saw that she was most solicitous of
his welfare, as only a daughter could be.</p>

<p>Later that night, there being the usual dance in the
big ballroom, Geoffrey went in, and being attracted
by her, invited her to dance with him, and she
accepted.</p>

<p>She was alone. The old man had retired to bed.</p>

<p>Geoffrey&#8217;s interest was purely one of curiosity. The
girl-wife seemed to be carrying out her duty to her
father, and was terribly bored in doing so.</p>

<p>Before they parted that night he learned that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
had come from Serbia, and that her name was Marya
Pavlovitch. She had married a state official a year
and a half before. Her father&#8217;s name was Colonel
Yovan Vanoff, a well-known officer of the King&#8217;s
Guard at Belgrade, who had fought valiantly against
the Turks in the first Balkan war, and had gained
distinction at the decisive Battle of Kumanovo.</p>

<p>&#8220;My husband is in England,&#8221; she told Geoffrey,
speaking English well. &#8220;He is attached to the Serbian
Mission. So I am here with my father, who, alas!
is becoming daily more feeble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next evening they met again&mdash;and the next. The
old man was most affable, and day after day they had
long chats in French, in which Lane often joined.</p>

<p>One afternoon Geoffrey went by boat along to Lucerne,
eager and anxious. Mrs. Beverley and Sylvia had
arrived at the Schweizerhof, that great hotel which
overlooks the lake. They had tired of the Trossachs,
and also of dusty London, so in accordance with young
Falconer&#8217;s suggestion, they had arrived to spend a
couple of weeks in &#8220;lovely Lucerne&#8221;&mdash;that town
in which, before the war, one could spend a week under
the wing of any tourist company for the modest sum of
five guineas, railway fare included.</p>

<p>Geoffrey met Sylvia and her mother, and after half
an hour in the great lounge of the hotel they dined
together. The &#8220;Wild Widow&#8221; was charmed with
the hotel and its outlook, while Sylvia, delighted
at the retirement of the penurious Lord Hendlewycke,
who now no longer visited them, contrived to snatch a
few moments alone with her lover.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember, Geoffrey, what you told me&mdash;that
mysterious message by wireless telephone warning
you not to go East?&#8221; she said anxiously, as they sat
in the corridor after dinner, while her mother had
gone upstairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;But really the whole thing
was so ridiculous. It was, I&#8217;m convinced, only some
amateur playing a practical joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps. But you should take no risks, dear,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
she replied. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the situation. Remember
all that has passed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you so anxious?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she answered, glancing around, &#8220;you are,
no doubt, a marked man, Geoff. You have been able
to upset the plans of various conspirators, and they,
no doubt, seek their revenge. Hence, be careful&mdash;do
be very careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey laughed. He ridiculed the idea that any
vengeance should be attempted upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have only done my duty, my dear Sylvia!&#8221;
he laughed. &#8220;My duty to the company and my duty
to the Nation. Everybody surely understands that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; the girl replied; &#8220;everybody does not
understand. You, as an honest man, are at enmity
with a certain revolutionary section of society. They
know it. And they may lay their plans accordingly,&#8221;
she said warningly. &#8220;I, of course, have no knowledge
of any such plot&mdash;but I do urge you, Geoffrey, to keep
very wide awake. I have some strange intuition that
something may happen to you. Why&mdash;I can&#8217;t tell
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Sylvia, I hope I am always wide awake,&#8221;
he laughed, kissing her clandestinely in the shadows,
while a few moments later Mrs. Beverley reappeared.</p>

<p>Next morning mother and daughter went up by the
railway from Alpnach to the Pilatuskulm, where they
lunched with the young engineer and his friend Lane,
and afterwards ascended to the newly constructed
wireless station. It was not yet in working order,
but Sylvia was highly interested, for she had by that
time quite a good superficial knowledge of the apparatus
and the power-plant, which, by the way, was almost
a replica of the set which Geoffrey had installed at
Bouvignes Aerodrome, in Belgium.</p>

<p>In the evening they went down again to Lucerne,
but not until the following evening did Geoffrey again
see the girl with whom he was so deeply in love. As
soon as he had finished his work in that high-up spot
on the Tomlishorn, he returned to the hotel, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
changing his clothes, descended to Lucerne and dined
with the South American widow and her daughter.</p>

<p>Afterwards he went out with Sylvia on to the
veranda. The night was a glorious one, the full
moon rendering the lake and mountains a scene fairy-like
and beautiful such as is presented perhaps nowhere
else in the world. The view from the Schweizerhof
on a moonlit night is always superb.</p>

<p>Again Sylvia returned to the strange warning from
the ether which Geoffrey had received. She again
confessed that she somehow felt uncomfortable about
it. But her lover only pooh-poohed the affair, telling
her that it was not the first time that jokes had been
played by wireless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, not long ago,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the operator at one
of the aerodromes for civil flying was spoken to over
the wireless telephone by the Air Minister himself,
who explained that he was flying from Scotland in a
certain machine, and that in half an hour he intended
to descend at that aerodrome. There was a great bustle
at the news, but though they waited till dark the
Minister never arrived. And not until next day did
they learn that it was a hoax played by one of the
pilots.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl laughed, but still she urged Geoffrey to
take care.</p>

<p>&#8220;You really cannot be too careful,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;I tell you I have once or twice experienced a strange
presage of evil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you make me feel quite nervy!&#8221; he declared,
and then, as the air was cold, they returned to the palm-court,
where Mrs. Beverley was seated.</p>

<p>The widow and her daughter remained in Lucerne
for a fortnight, and then leaving Geoffrey to complete
his work, went on by way of the Gothard to Milan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Marya Pavlovitch and her father remained
at the Hôtel Pilatuskulm, and both Geoffrey and Lane
frequently met them. The girl-wife was most devoted
to her father, who was often in a grumpy mood, as is
usual with men of advanced age and slight infirmity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Young Madame Pavlovitch was naturally filled with
curiosity concerning the new wireless station&mdash;for to
ladies wireless is usually an enigma to be studied as
part of Nature&#8217;s half-revealed problem&mdash;and several
times, leaving her father, she had ascended the steep
rock-girt road to the higher heights where, upon a
little grass-grown plateau, the two new huts had been
built.</p>

<p>Three weeks passed. Geoffrey completed his work,
and made tests. The results were perfectly satisfactory.
The telephony was reported as &#8220;R.9&#8221; over
the Alps as far as Genoa, and to Marseilles, Coltano
in Italy, Munich, Paris, and other places.</p>

<p>The range of speech was even further than what
had been anticipated at the Works at Chelmsford.
Other wireless systems had been tried by the Swiss
Government, and had not come up to the standard
required. But here the Marconi Company had scored
another success over its competitors.</p>

<p>Since Sylvia&#8217;s departure, Geoffrey had often met
young Madame Pavlovitch, sometimes on the boat
between Alpnach and Lucerne, and sometimes in the
streets of Lucerne, for she went there nearly every
other day to obtain medicines for her father, she
explained. On two occasions he had seen her enter a
large detached private house in the Bruchstrasse, not
far from the Synagogue. She had not, however, seen
him, and he had not mentioned the matter. Yet it
seemed apparent that the reason of her visits to Lucerne
was to call at the house in question. And further,
she always seemed annoyed whenever he met her on
the way backwards or forwards along the lake.</p>

<p>One day Geoffrey had returned from the wireless
station, and was taking his tea in the lounge, when the
hotel manager came to him hurriedly and mentioned
that the Colonel had been taken suddenly unwell,
and that his daughter could not be found. She had gone
to Lucerne after luncheon, he believed.</p>

<p>As the matter seemed one of urgency, and as the
young Englishman was going to spend the evening in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Lucerne, he resolved while on board the boat to go to
the house in the Bruchstrasse, see whether Marya was
there, and inform her of her father&#8217;s illness.</p>

<p>This he did. A rather tall, elderly man-servant
opened the door, and when he inquired for Madame
Pavlovitch he ushered him into a cosy, beautifully-furnished
room, and without inquiring his name, closed
the door and left him.</p>

<p>The room was divided from the adjoining apartment
by long white-enamelled folding doors which stood
slightly ajar. The man-servant must have forgotten
to inform madame of his presence there, for he had
been in the room hardly half a minute when into the
next room, a big place decorated in white and gold,
there came several men who looked like officers in
mufti, accompanied by three women, one of whom was
little Madame Pavlovitch.</p>

<p>He could not fail to hear what they were earnestly
discussing in French. He stood aghast. They were
planning the assassination of Andra Nikolitch, the
well-known Serbian statesman, who was now President
of the Council, and was at the moment staying with
the Serbian Crown Prince at the Luzerner-Hof!</p>

<p>The terms in which the matter was being discussed
admitted of no doubt that the Colonel&#8217;s pretty daughter
was at its head, and that the attempt was to be made
one morning when the statesman took his usual walk
under the trees of the Schweizerhof-Quai.</p>

<p>Geoffrey stood astounded at his discovery. From
their conversation it was also plain that at the same
time other Ministers were to be murderously attacked
in Belgrade.</p>

<p>Suddenly the serious fact dawned upon the young
fellow that if he were discovered there he would not
be allowed to leave that house alive. Balkan conspirators
are not to be trifled with. They hold human
life of but little account.</p>

<p>Falconer saw that his only chance of safety was to
face the situation boldly. He placed his hand upon
his hip-pocket to reassure himself that his revolver was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
there. Then, suddenly, he stepped forth into the big
room and stood before those who had assembled to
discuss their dastardly plans.</p>

<p>His appearance caused a sensation almost electrical.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; gasped the dark-eyed Marya. &#8220;It is
M&#8217;sieur Falconer!&#8221;</p>

<p>Next second he was surrounded by the angry company,
and in more than one hand he saw an automatic pistol.
He was besieged by questions. What could he reply?</p>

<p>He attempted to explain the situation, declaring that
he was simply a victim of circumstances, adding:</p>

<p>&#8220;I confess I have overheard your most interesting
discussion!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Englishman has been spying upon us!&#8221; cried
a tall, rather elegant man in a dark suit. &#8220;If he is
not silenced&mdash;and at once&mdash;he will tell the police!
Remember, comrades, he is our enemy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet M&#8217;sieur Falconer is also my friend!&#8221; declared
the pretty Marya, springing forward boldly. &#8220;I,
however, had no idea that he was in this house!&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey tried to explain, but the clamour of the
others was too great. He told madame that her father
was ill, but they only laughed&mdash;declaring it to be an
excuse. Hence he saw that unwittingly he had entered
a veritable hornets&#8217; nest, and that retreat was impossible.
If he valued his life he would be compelled to
stay and face the music.</p>

<p>He defied them, daring them to lay a finger upon
him. But at madame&#8217;s urgent request he withdrew
his words.</p>

<p>&#8220;This house is closely guarded,&#8221; she explained,
&#8220;but the servant, Boris, having seen us together at
the hotel and at other places, no doubt believed you
to be one of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you must become one!&#8221; declared an elderly
man who seemed to be in authority over the rest.
&#8220;You know our secret! So you will join us&mdash;to-night&mdash;now!
From this moment you will be watched night
and day. If you attempt to warn the authorities you
will pay for it with your life!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>Geoffrey protested, but in vain.</p>

<p>Then he was sworn in English and in French.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Marya Pavlovitch turned to the young
wireless engineer, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will now tell you the truth, M&#8217;sieur Falconer. I
told you that my husband is in England with the
Serbian Mission, but the fact is that he was recalled
to Belgrade two months ago, and on arrival he was
immediately arrested by order of his enemy, the President
of the Council, Andra Nikolitch. A false charge
of treason was brought against him, and he was tried
in secret and shot,&#8221; and her voice trembled with emotion.
&#8220;He was entirely innocent. Of that I know. Hence we
have resolved to rid our country of certain of its unjust
rulers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are a widow, madame,&#8221; Falconer
remarked. &#8220;And what is intended is your revenge&mdash;eh?
My silence will cost Andra Nikolitch and others
their lives!&#8221; he added very slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the man who had urged his companions
to kill him there and then. &#8220;Understand, it is either
your life&mdash;or theirs!&#8221;</p>

<p>The young engineer did not reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are now one of us,&#8221; the man went on in a
deep, hard voice. &#8220;From this moment you will be
closely watched, and any attempt you make to reveal
what you know to any person will be followed immediately
by death. Please do not forget that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must now hurry back to my father,&#8221; said madame.
&#8220;The meeting is at an end.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Falconer left the house with her and returned
to Alpnach.</p>

<p>He could now understand Marya&#8217;s wild, bitter hatred
of the man who had sent her innocent husband to his
death. On the way back he again mentioned it, but
she seemed disinclined to discuss the tragedy.</p>

<p>&#8220;When is the blow to be dealt!&#8221; he asked in a low
whisper in order not to be overheard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; was her answer, &#8220;The time is
not fixed.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>&#8220;But I do not like the idea of being constantly
watched,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It will really be most irritating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had not submitted you would not have left
that house alive,&#8221; replied the pretty, dark-eyed young
woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to thank you, madame,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Yet
the knowledge I have gained has upset me considerably.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you not think that these fiends who
murdered my husband richly deserve the fate we have
in store for them?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Upon that point, however, Falconer refused to
express an opinion.</p>

<p>As they entered the lounge of the hotel, he was
surprised to see a thin-faced, elderly man seated in
a chair pretending to read a paper. Instantly he
recognised him as one of the group of plotters he had
met in Lucerne. He had already reached the
Pilatuskulm, and was undoubtedly there in order to
keep observation upon him. Indeed he found that
the man, who had given the name of Vulkovitch at
the bureau, had engaged the room adjoining his own.</p>

<p>He had hardly entered his room when there was a
low tap on the door and Vulkovitch entered, with a
word of apology.</p>

<p>&#8220;I need not tell you, M&#8217;sieur Falconer, why I am here.
The object of my visit is to impress upon you the necessity
for complete secrecy. It was all the fault of Boris,
who, believing you to be one of us, admitted you,
but as you have now become associated with us, you
must conform to the rules already laid down. If you
breathe a single word of what is in progress, then I
shall use this!&#8221;</p>

<p>And he produced from his inner pocket a large silver
cigar-case.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not so harmless as it may appear,&#8221; he went
on. &#8220;It contains an explosive so powerful that if
thrown down it would wreck half the hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And incidentally blow you to pieces,&#8221; remarked
Falconer, regarding the case with interest.</p>

<p>The man smiled, and replied quietly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>&#8220;If I have occasion to use it I shall myself take
certain precautions. Only you would suffer, m&#8217;sieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope it won&#8217;t be necessary for you to send
me into the next world,&#8221; laughed the young man.
&#8220;But certainly the situation is a decidedly unpleasant
one&mdash;for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And equally for me,&#8221; the Serbian replied. &#8220;I
regret that I am selected for this not over-pleasant
duty, and I only hope you will thoroughly understand
what my friends have decided. So I wish you good-night,&#8221;
and bowing politely he left the room.</p>

<p>Geoffrey Falconer obtained but little sleep that
night. The whole thing seemed like a nightmare&mdash;the
oath of secrecy which he had taken, madame&#8217;s
tragic story, and her fierce revenge. It seemed that
she was paying all the expenses of that group of wild,
political extremists from Belgrade.</p>

<p>Next day everywhere Geoffrey went he was followed
silently and unobtrusively by the man Vulkovitch.
He had a chat with Lane, but within hearing of the
man, and pleading being unwell, he did not go up to
the wireless station, but remained in the hotel all day
in sight of the silent watcher.</p>

<p>He spent the afternoon with the little widow,
whose father had recovered, but had not yet left his
room.</p>

<p>After tea they went for a stroll together along the
mountain path, and Vulkovitch, noticing that he was
with her, relaxed his vigilance.</p>

<p>When alone she told him a great deal. She had
been passionately fond of her late husband, who, before
the war, had been assistant private secretary to King
Peter of Serbia. Afterwards he had entered the diplomatic
service, serving at the Legation in Paris. Then,
when war broke out, he joined his regiment and fought
valiantly against the Austrians until the terrible retreat.
After the Peace he had been appointed to the Serbian
Mission sent to London. But for the past six months,
because he had discovered scandals concerning certain
of the Serbian Ministers, he had been a marked man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and had eventually fallen the victim of a deliberate
plot to close his lips by death.</p>

<p>Her father, however, knew nothing of what was in
progress. She withheld the truth of her widowhood
from him on account of his weak state of health.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am greatly annoyed at being constantly watched
as I am,&#8221; Geoffrey declared frankly. &#8220;I am unable to
continue my work at the wireless station because your
friends fear that I may reveal the truth to somebody.
The situation is most unpleasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I quite understand, M&#8217;sieur Falconer,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;It was quite by accident that Boris admitted
you. You thought to perform a friendly action towards
me, and instead you stepped into our group. But I
beg of you to have patience. I feared last night that
they might kill you. They are all desperate persons,
I assure you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you form the complot?&#8221; asked the young
radio-engineer.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. They did. They came to me and told me
my husband had been tried by secret court-martial
and executed, and then suggested revenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey reflected a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;They came to you suggesting that you should bear
the expenses of the plot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I inherited a considerable fortune from my
aunt, and they suggested that I should take this
patriotic step, for by avenging the death of my poor
husband I should rid Serbia of her enemies who are
posing as her friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey pointed out that there could be no excuse
for assassination, but she instantly became angry,
declaring that she demanded blood for blood.</p>

<p>Two days passed. Wherever Falconer went the
silent Vulkovitch watched him until it got upon his
nerves. He scarcely dared to exchange words with
Lane, who naturally grew curious as to his colleague&#8217;s
change of manner, for he had suddenly become quite
morose. And naturally, for were not the lives of
several Serbian statesmen in his hands? He longed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
to warn the Serbian Premier of his peril. But
how?</p>

<p>He longed to leave Switzerland and fly back to
England&mdash;but he knew the consequences. Those plotters
would follow him, and he would share the same fate
as that intended for Andra Nikolitch and certain
members of his Cabinet.</p>

<p>The third day was a Wednesday, and he had learnt
that on Friday a meeting was to be held in Lucerne to
fix for the following day the attempt upon the well-known
statesman.</p>

<p>He was beside himself in agony of mind. These
men&mdash;men whom he had never met&mdash;were to be
murdered in cold blood. Yet he was powerless to
raise a finger to save them. King Alexander and his
Queen Draga had long ago fallen victims of secret
assassins, while more than one Minister in Serbia had
died under suspicious circumstances. Both Serbia
and Bulgaria&mdash;where the poor Prime Minister,
Stambuloff, and his successor, Petroff, had both been
assassinated&mdash;were hotbeds of political intrigue.</p>

<p>Geoffrey, though a threat of death was held over
him, had during those two days acted with caution.
On the Friday morning he met Lane in the lounge
where the silent watcher was standing, and handed
him a cigarette from his case, at the same time saying
that he had to go into Lucerne, hence he could not go
to the wireless station that day.</p>

<p>Then he whispered a few quick words that caused
his friend to start.</p>

<p>Lane struck a match, but made only pretence of
lighting his cigarette.</p>

<p>Instead, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. Cheerio! I&#8217;ll see you here to-night.
The station is on test now. You really must come up
and see it to-morrow.&#8221; And then he turned away.</p>

<p>Two minutes later Lane was back in his bedroom
alone, carefully examining his cigarette. Unrolling
it, he found upon the paper a message written in an
almost microscopical hand telling him of the meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of the conspirators at Lucerne that evening and its
object, and urging him to take the paper at once to
the Lucerne police.</p>

<p>Lane contrived to get to Lucerne, where he saw
the Prefect of Police and showed him the paper. It
bore the address in the Bruchstrasse; therefore, police
agents at once kept observation upon the place, a fact
which in secret Lane communicated to Falconer by a
meaning glance at the luncheon table, for Falconer
always sat at a little table with madame and her father,
while Lane sat with two other men close by. One of
the men was the silent watcher.</p>

<p>Falconer, though young, was a man of quick initiative.
He was in a cleft stick and surrounded by unscrupulous
enemies. Therefore he had set his brains to outwit them.</p>

<p>The final meeting of the plotters, before the Minister
was to be assassinated by a bomb, was fixed for nine
o&#8217;clock that night. At six o&#8217;clock he watched for
madame, who was, he knew, going to Lucerne to be
present. She came down, smartly dressed, and as
she went out, he hastened and overtook her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame Pavlovitch,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;I want a
word with you&mdash;a serious word.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped suddenly, and then they strolled across
the gravelled drive.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you are going to Lucerne. But I warn
you not to go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; she asked, surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because if you do you will be arrested for conspiracy,&#8221;
he replied firmly. &#8220;Further, you are only
being made a tool of by a band of anarchists who are
using your money for their own personal ends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she demanded resentfully.
&#8220;Have you betrayed us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have betrayed the men who have betrayed you,&#8221;
was his answer. &#8220;Let us walk along, and I&#8217;ll tell you
the truth,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Utterly amazed at the risk which the young Englishman
had taken, she strolled at his side and listened
eagerly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>&#8220;Those people have lied to you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They
are hoping to carry out a scheme by which certain of
your Ministers are to be killed from motives of personal
vengeance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have told you a lurid story concerning your
husband&mdash;that he has been executed. Instead he is
in prison at Belgrade for six months. Next week he
will be liberated!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alive!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;Is Danilo alive? He has
never written to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because your friends the conspirators have intercepted
his letters. The man Vulkovitch was taken
away from here directly after lunch, and since then
I have been in secret wireless communication with the
Minister of Justice in Belgrade, from whom I have
discovered the true facts concerning your husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must go to Lucerne to-night,&#8221; she said,
somewhat disinclined to give credit to his story.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you go there it will be at your peril. A raid
will be made upon the house, and all will be arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you fooling me, M&#8217;sieur Falconer?&#8221; she asked,
facing him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly am not,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Keep away
from Lucerne, and you will find the whole of the men,
who have been posing as your friends and taking your
money under false pretences, in the hands of the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>At first she was undecided, but he repeated that if
she went to Lucerne it was at her own risk.</p>

<p>He had denounced the plotters, and thus saved the
lives of innocent men&mdash;but he had given no information
concerning her, he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Instead of going to Lucerne, leave Switzerland
forthwith, madame,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;Get away&mdash;now
there is yet time. Within a week I guarantee that
your husband will be free.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dark-haired young woman took Falconer&#8217;s
advice, and two hours later, accompanied by her father,
she left the hotel. Meanwhile the Lucerne police that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
night arrested the whole group, and found in the house
bombs, firearms, and correspondence which proved
beyond doubt the truth of what the young Englishman
had written upon the cigarette-paper.</p>

<p>With the exception of madame, the whole desperate
group subsequently appeared before the Assize Court
of Lucerne, and were all sent to long terms of
imprisonment.</p>

<p>But before the trial took place Geoffrey had received
a letter from Marya, dated from Paris, telling him that
her husband had reappeared as though from the grave,
and that they were again united.</p>

<p>And now the most curious part of the whole affair
is to be related.</p>

<p>Let it be told in Sylvia Beverley&#8217;s own words, as
she told it to her lover in the drawing-room at Upper
Brook Street a week later.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Geoff,&#8221; she said, &#8220;as I told you, I had a
curious presage of evil concerning you. Why, I can&#8217;t
tell. Something seemed to impress upon my mind
the fact that if you went East you would be in peril.
Days&mdash;weeks went on until I became obsessed by the
feeling that something was about to happen to you.
Perhaps it was an intuition because we love each other
so dearly. Yet the fact remains, I was in fear. And
because of that, I went to an amateur wireless experimenter
whom I know&mdash;a man at Folkestone&mdash;and I
got him to speak that mysterious message to you over
the radio-telephone&mdash;that message of warning!&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her hand in his, and their lips met in a long,
passionate caress.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>THE CROW&#8217;S CLIFF</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Beverley</span> was giving one of her usual dinner-parties
at Upper Brook Street. Among the guests
were two Cabinet Ministers and their wives, for money
can always command guests, the names of whom will
be duly recorded in the society column of the <i>Morning
Post</i> next day.</p>

<p>Money buys publicity, and without the latter nowadays
one may as well live in suburbia, or in the peace
of a country village.</p>

<p>When the hostess and her guests went to the drawing-room,
Geoffrey&mdash;who had just come back from making
some adjustments at the wireless station at Renfrew&mdash;managed
to snatch a quarter of an hour with Sylvia
in the cosy little sitting-room next to the library.</p>

<p>The young engineer had been telling her of his work
up in Scotland, and of a pleasant Saturday he had spent
up Loch Lomond, when the girl suddenly asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you like Mrs. Mapleton, whom you took
into dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, very nice,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I suppose she&#8217;s
a new friend of your mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. We met her and her husband a year ago
when we were at Hyères. They live near Madrid, and
have asked us to go and stay with them for a month
at their villa outside the city. Mother has accepted.
Didn&#8217;t I hear you say that you might be sent out on
business to Madrid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. There was some mention of it the other day,&#8221;
Geoffrey replied. &#8220;They were having trouble with
their valve-panel at the wireless station at Aranjuez,
which belongs to the Compania Naçional, and I heard
that it was proposed that I should go out to see what
I can make of it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>&#8220;How splendid if we are in Madrid together&mdash;eh?&#8221;
exclaimed the girl enthusiastically. &#8220;I do hope we
shall manage it. The Mapletons go back in six weeks&#8217;
time, and we go with them. He&#8217;s an English banker
in Madrid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just at that moment one of the guests entered the
room, so the lovers were forced to return to the drawing-room,
where a little later Geoffrey found himself talking
to the rather handsome young woman who had sat
beside him at dinner. She was dark, with a very clear
complexion and great black eyes, a graceful figure,
and a sweet and winning smile. Her husband, to
whom she introduced him, was some ten years her
senior, a tall, rather spare man with an aquiline face
somewhat bronzed by the southern sun.</p>

<p>They chatted together, whereupon Mrs. Mapleton
mentioned that Mrs. Beverley and her daughter were
travelling with them to Madrid. Then Geoffrey
remarked that he would, in all probability, be in the
Spanish capital at the same time, and explained the
reason of his journey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you are in Madrid, Mr. Falconer, you won&#8217;t
fail to come and see us&mdash;will you?&#8221; urged the lady.
&#8220;We live out at El Pardo&mdash;only half an hour from
Madrid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey thanked her, and promised that if he went
to Spain he would certainly call upon her.</p>

<p>Two months later he found himself at the old-fashioned
Hôtel de Pastor at Aranjuez, which is thirty miles from
the capital, and not far from the great wireless station.
After remaining there two days making his preliminary
investigations of the work he had in hand, he one day
took train to Madrid, and went out in a taxi along the
terribly dusty road to El Pardo.</p>

<p>He found the house without any difficulty&mdash;a great
country mansion in the Spanish style&mdash;surrounded by
beautiful grounds. The door was opened by an elderly
English butler, who showed him in and took his card
at once to his mistress. In a few seconds Sylvia, who
had been eagerly watching her lover&#8217;s arrival, rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
forward and greeted him warmly, while almost at the
same moment their hostess appeared and gladly
welcomed the young fellow.</p>

<p>It was just before luncheon, so Geoffrey, after being
shown the glorious gardens and the views, was compelled
to remain, and sat down with Mrs. Mapleton, her
husband, the South American widow, and Sylvia. The
meal was served with considerable pomp by the butler,
Martin, the whole staff of servants being English. Mrs.
Mapleton, when Martin was out of the room, remarked
that she had become tired of the slovenly ways of
Spanish servants, and therefore she had engaged English
ones, all of them having been in service with English
families in France or Italy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin is, of course, our mainstay,&#8221; she added.
&#8220;He speaks Spanish well, which is a great thing, as we
naturally have many Spanish visitors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Mapleton; &#8220;Martin is a real treasure
for a busy man like myself. He was in the service
of the Marquis de Borja, secretary to Queen Marie
Christine, and only left after his master&#8217;s death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are very lucky to get him,&#8221; remarked
Mrs. Beverley. &#8220;I know what it is to have a butler
upon whom one can rely. A widow like myself is very
handicapped in that respect. I am no judge of wine.
I leave it all to my man, and I trust him implicitly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as we trust Martin,&#8221; said the banker&#8217;s good-looking
wife, and then the entrance of the sedate and
respectful servant put an end to further discussion.</p>

<p>Luncheon over, Mrs. Mapleton proposed a run in
the car over to El Escorial, the favourite summer
resort of the Madrileños, where they visited the wonderful
Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo del Escorial, the huge
pile of whitish granite, destitute of ornament, and
broken by small windows; one of the most remarkable
edifices of all time which seems to rise out of the stony
sides of the great Guadarrama Mountains, and resembles,
except in its majestic façade, a fortress or a prison.</p>

<p>&#8220;How wonderful!&#8221; exclaimed Sylvia, as they were
conducted into the magnificent church built on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
model of the original plan of St. Peter&#8217;s in Rome, with
its forty-eight altars, each containing a valuable painting,
its magnificent frescoes, and the immense high altar of
valuable marbles and exquisitely gilded bronzes, before
which many candles were burning. They were shown
the Sacristia, the Panteén de los Reyes, or burial vault
of the Spanish monarchs, the Library, and afterwards
the Royal Palace.</p>

<p>Later they motored back along a road below which,
in the gorgeous Spanish sunset, lay the plain of New
Castile and Madrid on the one hand, and the
Guadarrama Mountains on the other.</p>

<p>Next evening Geoffrey again returned to El Pardo,
and as he stood with Sylvia and Mrs. Mapleton upon
the terrace of the villa, the banker&#8217;s wife pointed across
to a towering rock upon the edge of the mountains.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over there is the Crow&#8217;s Cliff,&#8221; she said. &#8220;From
it, through many centuries, those guilty of murder were
hurled. Indeed, even during the past few years
battered bodies of men and women have been found
beneath it, victims of those who have taken justice
into their own hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How horrible!&#8221; exclaimed the smart young South
American girl. &#8220;When was the last body found?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About a year ago&mdash;a labourer in a vineyard close
by, on going to work one morning, found the body of
a well-dressed young woman. She was believed to
be English by her clothes, but she was never identified.
The police have abandoned their inquiries, as it is a
complete mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was purposely pushed over the Cliff, I suppose?&#8221;
remarked Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; replied his hostess. &#8220;But it is believed
that there have been cases where the guilty have been
condemned and executed by their fellows in order to
suppress any scandal. More than one person moving
in the highest circles has been found dead beneath
the Crow&#8217;s Cliff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we go up there and see it?&#8221; suggested
Geoffrey.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>&#8220;Certainly you could,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;There is a
good road, though rather hilly, and a path which takes
you close to the edge of the Cliff.&#8221;</p>

<p>So all three went to see the Crow&#8217;s Cliff.</p>

<p>The road proved badly kept and shadeless, as are
most of the roads in Spain, and the path was rocky
and crooked as they ascended to the summit of the
Peña Grajera&mdash;the Crow&#8217;s Cliff.</p>

<p>At last all three walked to the edge of the precipice,
where through the ages so many of the guilty ones
had been hurled to destruction.</p>

<p>&#8220;That story about the young Englishwoman haunts
me!&#8221; Geoffrey said to Sylvia as they approached the
place and peered down upon the river winding across
the plain below, which stretched away into the evening
mist. &#8220;I wonder who she was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody will ever know,&#8221; declared Mrs. Mapleton.
&#8220;Here in Spain many murders are committed on account
of jealousy or revenge. No doubt the motive was either
one or the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Terrible!&#8221; exclaimed Sylvia, shuddering at the
thought of being flung over upon the crags below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. In Spain they regard death at the Crow&#8217;s
Cliff as the most ignominious end any person can suffer,&#8221;
remarked her hostess. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard all sorts of weird
stories about the place, which was a place of execution
long before the days of the Inquisition. The peasantry
believe that on certain nights the ghosts of black-robed
and masked executioners haunt this road.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course the ignorant country folk would naturally
invent all sorts of horrible stories.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a horrible spot altogether,&#8221; declared
Falconer. And the party walked back to El Pardo
together, where they dined late, and it was past midnight
before Geoffrey arrived back at Aranjuez.</p>

<p>While during the next few days he continued his
work at the great wireless station there&mdash;the station
known to all wireless men as &#8220;E.A.A.,&#8221; and which
works so regularly with Poldhu&mdash;Sylvia and her mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
were taken about the country by their hostess to see
old-world Toledo, Villarrubia, Talavera, and the Tetas
de Viana.</p>

<p>A bald-headed Spanish doctor named Garcia, with
his wife, a very handsome woman, had arrived from
Burgos, and were also guests of the Mapletons. The
Garcias had lived in Madrid for several years, and were
great friends of the Mapletons.</p>

<p>Indeed the truth was that when Dr. Garcia had
found himself in serious financial difficulties three years
before, the banker had secretly assisted him. Hence
the doctor was considerably in his debt.</p>

<p>One evening, a fortnight later, the party had been
out to dinner at a neighbouring house, and on their
return Mrs. Mapleton was suddenly taken very unwell.
Her husband and the others became greatly alarmed,
and the faithful Martin, who, in turn, became full of
apprehension, called Dr. Garcia, who had already
retired to bed.</p>

<p>The doctor, when he examined the lady and noted
the symptoms, came to the conclusion that she was
suffering from acute indigestion, to which, apparently,
she was subject. Something she had eaten at dinner
had no doubt affected her, for by three o&#8217;clock in the
morning she was much easier, and by next day the
attack had passed.</p>

<p>Indeed they motored into Madrid in the afternoon,
where they visited the wonderful private collection
of pictures belonging to the Duke of Alba, and the
Prado Museum, afterwards enjoying that wonderful
view from the Campillo de las Vistillas. Yet on the
same evening Mrs. Mapleton was again taken unwell,
and the same remedy which Dr. Garcia had prescribed
was resorted to, with the result that two hours later
she was quite herself again.</p>

<p>Next day when at breakfast, Mrs. Mapleton said
to Madame Garcia:</p>

<p>&#8220;These attacks of indigestion are most annoying.
Time after time I get them badly&mdash;and then I recover
just as suddenly as I am attacked. The first time I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
had one was a year ago&mdash;and I was terribly ill for
three days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the doctor has put you upon special diet,&#8221;
was madame&#8217;s reply. &#8220;If you keep to that you will
certainly be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin, who chanced to enter the room at the moment,
eagerly asked after his mistress&#8217;s health.</p>

<p>That same afternoon Sylvia had an appointment with
Geoffrey in Madrid. Her lover had been out at
Aranjuez, busily engaged all day trying to improve
the continuous-wave panel, and was in ignorance
of Mrs. Mapleton&#8217;s indisposition. They, however,
met as she had arranged, in the palm-court of the
great Ritz Hotel in the Plaza de Cànovas, and sat
down to a pleasant tea.</p>

<p>While chatting together the girl suddenly became
very serious, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something on my mind, Geoffrey&mdash;and&mdash;well,
I hardly know what to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On your mind!&#8221; he echoed. &#8220;Why, what about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, about Mrs. Mapleton. She&#8217;s had two sudden
and serious attacks on successive nights. Dr. Garcia,
whom you met at El Pardo, put it down to indigestion,
but&mdash;well, I don&#8217;t think it is,&#8221; said the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem worried about your hostess,&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. The fact is I&#8217;m suspicious of that woman,
Madame Garcia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, strictly between ourselves, Geoffrey, very
late the other night when every one was asleep I heard
Mr. Mapleton quarrelling with his wife, and the doctor&#8217;s
wife was mentioned by our hostess, who is, no doubt,
jealous of her, though she will not show it in public.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Then Mrs. Mapleton is jealous of madame&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And this knowledge has aroused my suspicion.
If Mr. Mapleton admires madame, there may be some
subtle plot to get Mrs. Mapleton out of the way!&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>Geoffrey looked at her open-mouthed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>&#8220;Do you really believe that?&#8221; he asked quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I most certainly do. I haven&#8217;t mentioned anything
to mother,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;But I shall be very glad
to get away from the place. I&#8217;m going to urge mother
to make an excuse and cut short our visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Don&#8217;t do that,&#8221; he answered quickly. &#8220;If
evil is intended, as you surmise, then your place is there
to watch carefully and report to me. Our duty is to
save the lady and expose the plot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spaniards are experts with poisons,&#8221; Sylvia
remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. Therefore we should both act warily,
and await the next development. In the meantime I
will make some inquiries regarding the Garcias, who
are so well-known here in Madrid.&#8221;</p>

<p>What Sylvia had suggested at once aroused Geoffrey&#8217;s
curiosity, and that evening he took his idol back to the
Mapletons at El Pardo, where he was invited to remain
to dinner.</p>

<p>He watched Mr. Mapleton and the doctor&#8217;s wife
very carefully, but he could not detect any sign of
undue admiration. Indeed the banker scarcely took
any notice of her, being much more attentive to Mrs.
Beverley, his guest, while the bald-headed Dr. Garcia
was most affable to Geoffrey himself.</p>

<p>The dinner was a merry meal, and every one was
chatting about the lovely motor-run they had made
during the warm afternoon out to Sonseca, in the
Mountains of Toledo, while Martin, grave-faced and
urbane, served his master&#8217;s guests in eloquent silence.</p>

<p>Falconer, sorely puzzled, left early to get back to
Aranjuez. He could now fully understand the suspicions
of Sylvia, yet he felt inclined to dismiss them, for he
could discover nothing unusual in the Mapleton <i>ménage</i>.</p>

<p>Next evening, however, after his work was over, he
went into Madrid in order to institute the inquiries he
had promised Sylvia to make.</p>

<p>Of several persons whom he had met since his arrival
from England he made inquiry regarding Dr. Garcia.
From an old Spaniard, who was manager of an antique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
shop in the Calle de Don Pedro, and whom he had met
out at Aranjuez with one of the wireless operators, he
learned a few interesting facts concerning the bald-headed
doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; replied the old fellow in broken English,
&#8220;Dr. Garcia is very well known in Madrid. He
married a woman from Burgos, Carolina Almagro,
about five years ago. She was previously engaged to
marry the English banker, Señor Mapleton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; gasped Geoffrey. &#8220;Was Madame Garcia
once engaged to marry Mr. Mapleton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, señor. Every one in Madrid knows that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey Falconer held his breath, and remained
silent for a few moments.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how long has Mr. Mapleton been married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, about four years&mdash;not more. He married
an English lady&mdash;and a very nice lady she is. Once or
twice she has bought old furniture here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Dr. Garcia and his wife have left Madrid,&#8221;
Geoffrey remarked as they sat together in the dark
little shop, surrounded by all sorts of curios.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He sold the practice to Dr. Salcedo soon
after his marriage, and went away. I don&#8217;t know
where he is now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But tell me,&#8221; urged Geoffrey. &#8220;How is it that
the lady, being engaged to the banker, married the
doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man grinned, while his black eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a whisper of some scandal. They say
that is the reason why the doctor and his wife left
Madrid.&#8221;</p>

<p>All that was being told to Falconer went to establish
the motive why a secret attempt should be made upon
Mrs. Mapleton&#8217;s life. It was all news to Geoffrey. He
had believed that Mapleton had been married fully
ten years.</p>

<p>In other quarters he prosecuted inquiries, but the
result was always the same&mdash;the story of the sudden
marriage of the English banker&#8217;s Spanish fiancée,
and the gossip which ensued.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>Several further days passed, and then one evening
Geoffrey, having been to the Eslava Theatre, was
leaving in order to return to Aranjuez, when, to his
surprise, he saw walking along the dark street in front
of him the familiar figure of Mr. Mapleton, and at his
side was Madame Garcia!</p>

<p>They had evidently been to the theatre together.
He followed them unseen, and saw them enter the car,
and drive back to El Pardo together.</p>

<p>This, indeed, further aroused his suspicions concerning
Mrs. Mapleton&#8217;s repeated seizures.</p>

<p>Next afternoon he went to El Pardo again with the
express purpose of keeping his eyes open, and also of
telling Sylvia in confidence what he had learnt.</p>

<p>The pair while walking in the garden agreed that
there was distinct suspicion that either Mr. Mapleton
might be plotting to get rid of his wife, or that the
handsome Spanish woman might be endeavouring to
poison her rival through motives of jealousy. As
Sylvia pointed out, Mapleton was very rich, while
Madame Garcia was the wife of a poor professional
man in financial difficulties. The woman could not
obtain the luxuries, smart dresses, and sojourns at Aix,
Dinant, or San Sebastian, for which she longed.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is always deploring the fact that she leads
such a humdrum life,&#8221; the girl went on. &#8220;Only
yesterday she told me that she envied us, travelling
about as we do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, personally, I don&#8217;t like madame,&#8221; her lover
said. &#8220;Her eyes are cruel and vindictive, and she
seems to bear an entirely false affection for her hostess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Mapleton is charming,&#8221; declared Sylvia as
they halted on the terrace, from which a beautiful
view of Madrid could be seen across the plain. &#8220;I
wonder if her husband has any suspicion? Surely
Dr. Garcia could discover whether those mysterious
attacks are due to indigestion&mdash;or to foul play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The doctor&#8217;s wife would never let her husband
into her guilty secret,&#8221; Geoffrey said. Then after a
pause, he added: &#8220;Of course if the banker himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
had experienced similar seizures one could discern in
them a motive&mdash;namely, that the doctor being deeply
in his debt wanted to get rid of him, for by his death
he would get out of his heavy liabilities. But the
affair concerns only the banker&#8217;s wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a complete mystery, Geoff,&#8221; declared the
girl. &#8220;I watch them all closely day after day, but
I become more and more mystified. I long to tell
mother, but I have acted upon your advice, and kept
my own counsel. Only to-day at breakfast Mrs.
Mapleton, who, of course, is all unsuspecting, invited
the Garcias to remain for another fortnight. After
that they are going to Granada. And a week later
the Mapletons go to Barcelona, where he has a branch
of his bank, while we go back to London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then during the next fortnight we must be very
watchful,&#8221; Falconer said, and as at that moment Mrs.
Mapleton, walking with the handsome Madame Garcia,
came along the terrace, they dropped the subject, and
Falconer became most enthusiastic regarding the
glorious view.</p>

<p>Next morning at about ten o&#8217;clock Geoffrey Falconer
was busy re-wiring part of the powerful transmitting
apparatus at the wireless station at Aranjuez,
when one of the operators handed him a telegram
which had just been received over the land line from
Madrid.</p>

<p>It was open, upon a form, just as it had been
received. The words he read were:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<i>Another seizure. Unconscious for three hours.
Just recovered. Meet me at the Ritz in Madrid at
four this afternoon.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Geoffrey realised the extreme gravity of the situation.
He had been making many secret inquiries. The
mystery of it all had not only fascinated him, but it
had placed him upon his mettle. Sylvia, the girl
whom he loved so passionately, had, by her woman&#8217;s
shrewd keenness, first aroused the suspicion which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
daily grown stronger until the grave peril of the banker&#8217;s
charming wife obsessed him.</p>

<p>On five different occasions, from that complicated-looking
apparatus of the high-power wireless station,
with which at the moment he was surrounded, he had
sent out with great difficulty and very weakly in the
Marconi International Code, long messages to M.P.D.&mdash;or
Poldhu in Cornwall&mdash;inquiries concerning Mapleton
and others&mdash;which next day had been answered in
the same code.</p>

<p>These answers, unknown to Sylvia, had opened up
an entirely new channel of inquiry. That telegram
from El Pardo confirmed certain suspicions which
had come to him during the past two days.</p>

<p>That there was a deliberate and desperate attempt
to get rid of Mrs. Mapleton had become an established
fact. It only lay with Sylvia and her lover to save
the unfortunate victim, to lay bare the plot, and to
bring the guilty person or persons to their just
punishment.</p>

<p>When at four o&#8217;clock Sylvia met Geoffrey in the Ritz,
her first words were:</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Mrs. Mapleton had a terribly narrow escape
last night! Dr. Garcia grew very alarmed, and at
two o&#8217;clock this morning telephoned to Madrid to
Dr. Figueroa, who, I believe, is one of the most distinguished
pathologists in Spain. He arrived at about
half-past four, and in consultation agreed with Garcia
that it was acute indigestion. Fortunately, an hour
afterwards Mrs. Mapleton was quite well again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what was the attitude of Madame Garcia?&#8221;
asked Geoffrey eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, very agitated and fussy, of course, all of it
well assumed. She&#8217;s a most wonderful actress. All
the women of the South are the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But does Garcia know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel sure he is in complete ignorance. I watch
them all every hour&mdash;every minute&mdash;but I can find
no tangible evidence against anyone. The only motive
that there can be is Madame Garcia&#8217;s jealousy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>&#8220;Then she must be the culprit,&#8221; Falconer said.
&#8220;It is evident that she must somehow doctor her
hostess&#8217;s food&mdash;eh? But surely that must be difficult.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt, but it is being accomplished somehow,
for how is it that none of us suffer from any ill-effects?&#8221;
said the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you are not subject to &#8216;acute indigestion&#8217;
as Mrs. Mapleton is,&#8221; was his reply as he smiled
meaningly. &#8220;The attacks are certainly curious. They
seem to occur after eating, just as indigestion would
occur,&#8221; Falconer went on. &#8220;But how is it possible
that this Spanish woman can tamper with her hostess&#8217;s
food alone, unless she is in league with the cook, and
that is quite inconceivable. The whole history of
both Garcia, and his wife, and Mapleton and Mrs.
Mapleton certainly points to but one motive&mdash;Madame
Garcia&#8217;s jealousy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But do you think that Mr. Mapleton can have no
knowledge of what is in progress?&#8221; asked the girl
to whom the young wireless engineer was so devoted.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;m convinced that he has not. His friend
the doctor has diagnosed the complaint as indigestion,
hence he has no suspicions, and does not seek a further
medical opinion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is so. Mother only yesterday suggested to
him in private that he should ask for another doctor
to see his wife, but he declared that he had the greatest
confidence in Dr. Garcia&#8217;s judgment.&#8221; Then she added:
&#8220;It was Dr. Garcia himself who sent into Madrid for
another doctor this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we can do no more, save to still prosecute
inquiries, and watch the progress of events.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the next two days young Falconer was very
busy making some tests with Poldhu. From the
&#8220;Devil&#8217;s Oven,&#8221; far away on the rocky Cornish coast,
they at first sent him replies on &#8220;spark&#8221; in response,
but after twenty hours of hard work, during which they
constantly disturbed the ether by sending long and
numerous series of &#8220;V&#8217;s&#8221;&mdash;namely, three dots and a
dash&mdash;the letter of the alphabet used in wireless for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
testing purposes, his transmission was at last declared
by Poldhu to be &#8220;good,&#8221; but not anything really great&mdash;in
fact &#8220;R.7.,&#8221; as Poldhu put it.</p>

<p>There was still a fault somewhere, and amid that
tangle of wires, the mass of up-to-date apparatus, and
the great vacuum glass globes&mdash;huge balls of light
when transmission was in progress&mdash;he stood dismayed
and puzzled. A fault in wireless transmission is often
most difficult to trace, and it was so in this case. The
two engineers at Aranjuez had failed to discover it,
and for that reason young Falconer had been sent
over as an expert to find and remedy it. It was the
more baffling because after re-wiring it the first time,
he was able to communicate with Poldhu about Dr.
Garcia and Mapleton. Then a slight fault had necessitated
an alteration, and now it was again wrong.</p>

<p>As he stood there that morning gazing into the big
valve-panel, undecided as to what test next to apply,
one of the operators, a young Spaniard, handed him a
message form, saying that it had just come in from
Poldhu. It was in the International Code; therefore
Falconer went to the adjoining room, and taking down
the big book which gives a &#8220;figure&#8221; and &#8220;letter&#8221;
code in all the principal commercial languages,
including Japanese, he soon succeeded in de-coding
the message.</p>

<p>When he did so he sat back aghast. The truth was
now apparent.</p>

<p>His inquiries in London regarding the Mapletons
were slowly throwing a light upon a most dramatic
situation.</p>

<p>That day he felt justified in leaving his work early,
and in the evening he travelled to the far north of
Spain to San Sebastian, that gay seaside resort which
is the favourite summer resort of the Madrileños. He
arrived there in the early morning, having spent the
night in the so-called &#8220;express.&#8221; He took his coffee
at the old-fashioned Hôtel Ezcurra, in the Paseo de
la Zurriola, and then he went round to the Prefecture
of Police.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>To the rather lazy underling whom he found there
he made an explanation, and at ten o&#8217;clock he was
shown into the bureau of the chief of police himself,
an elderly, alert little man, who listened to the young
Englishman very attentively. As he proceeded with
his story, and as he related what had been sent by
wireless from England, the official&#8217;s interest grew.</p>

<p>For two hours Geoffrey Falconer remained there,
examining documents, and questioning four Spanish
detectives by the aid of the official interpreter.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, Señor Falconer,&#8221; said the chief of police
at last, &#8220;the best line of action for you is to return and
keep a secret and strict watch. You know all I have told
you, and what are my suspicions. It is fortunate,
very fortunate, that your young lady friend has
detected what is in progress. On my part I will
send by to-night&#8217;s mail a report to the police of Madrid,
who will be on the alert for any developments. They
will place our great pathologist, Professor Barrera,
at your disposal, should any analysis be required. We
are at the moment quite powerless to act, but we look
to you for such information as shall save the lady&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>

<p>About noon on the following day Falconer called
at the Mapleton&#8217;s house in El Pardo as though upon a
casual visit. As soon as he met Sylvia, the girl called
him aside, and whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you are here, Geoffrey. Mrs.
Mapleton had another attack last night, but is better
now. She is in the habit of eating but very little dinner,
and taking some patent invalid food just before going
to bed. I managed to save a little of it before Martin
cleared it away. I&#8217;ve got it in a bottle upstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent. I will take it at once to Professor
Barrera,&#8221; replied Falconer. &#8220;He will analyse it, and
see whether it has been doctored.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young Englishman remained to luncheon, and
then, without telling anyone of his journey to San
Sebastian, he went back to Madrid, and there saw
the Professor, who had already been warned by the
police.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>Next day, when Falconer called upon Professor
Barrera, he was told that into the invalid food had
been introduced the juice of a certain poisonous
mushroom which produced the exact symptoms of
acute indigestion, and which, when absorbed by the
human body, was almost impossible to detect. It
was one of the most subtle and dangerous poisons
known to modern toxicologists.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mushroom is a large dark-grey fungus with
scarlet spots and grows on the mountains. It is found
often in the Guadarrama,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Whoever is
using it must be an expert poisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that knowledge, and the other knowledge he
now possessed, Falconer waited until evening, and
then returned to El Pardo, where he was asked to
remain to dinner, and to sleep, as a motor excursion
had been arranged for the following day.</p>

<p>He dined, but though he went to his room, he could
not sleep. The night was moonlit, and from his window
he had a good view of the white road outside. Instead
of undressing, he watched that road through the night
hours until the first streak of dawn. It slowly became
light at about four o&#8217;clock, when suddenly he saw the
figure of a man going out upon a brisk walk.</p>

<p>Without a second&#8217;s hesitation he took his hat, and
creeping silently down the stairs, let himself out.</p>

<p>By that time the man, whose figure he had recognised
as Martin&#8217;s, was far ahead. The morning mist was
thick as, leaving the highway, he ascended the steep
hill-path, Geoffrey, whose rubber-soled boots made
but little noise, following swiftly.</p>

<p>The rough winding way led to the summit of the
Crow&#8217;s Cliff, until Martin at last reached the top.</p>

<p>Then Geoffrey saw the butler bending down, eagerly,
examining a patch of grass near the edge of the Cliff
He was searching for that deadly grey fungus with the
scarlet spots, which, when gathered at dawn, was most
dangerous to human life!</p>

<p>Falconer, modest in his scientific achievements, but
bold when faced with an alternative, saw the man in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the act of picking one of the mushrooms, and suddenly
sprang upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;At last, Martin!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;So it is you who
are trying to poison your mistress! Now I know
the truth!&#8221;</p>

<p>The fellow, his face blanched, flung himself free.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; shouted the exemplary
butler in wild defiance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that you are not Mrs. Mapleton&#8217;s servant at
all! You are her rightful husband, and moreover
you were a partner with her in certain shady transactions.
You and she ran a private gaming-house in
Bayswater, and afterwards at San Sebastian. From
the profits of the place Mrs. Mapleton derived her
private income, unknown to Mapleton, who believes
it is from Consols. Four years ago one, Paul Berton,
a rich French landowner, was robbed and died
mysteriously in that house in San Sebastian&mdash;killed
in circumstances which left no doubt in your wife&#8217;s
mind that you were the assassin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite untrue!&#8221; protested Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go on,&#8221; said Falconer. &#8220;Your wife hated
you, because you were a murderer. She fell in love
with Mapleton, and under threats of disclosing your
crime to the police, she compelled you to remain aside,
and she married the man she loved. Then you
persecuted the unfortunate woman, who believed that
she was safely out of your clutches. You compelled
her to engage you as her butler. Why? Your first
idea was to poison Mapleton, so that you should get
his money through his wife. But when she saw through
your plot and threatened to expose you, you sought
to secretly poison her, and thus close her lips&mdash;at the
same time throwing suspicion upon the jealous woman,
Madame Garcia!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A lie&mdash;an absolute lie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it is the truth, Mr. Sharman&mdash;<i>alias</i> Barnes&mdash;<i>alias</i>
half a dozen other names. Your record is at
Scotland Yard, together with your finger prints. I
have them in my pocket. Truly, yours is a dastardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and ingenious game. You poisoned poor Berton with
the same decoction of mushroom-juice that you are
now using on your wife!&#8221;</p>

<p>Without a second&#8217;s delay the man Martin sprang at
Geoffrey, who was close to the edge of the Crow&#8217;s Cliff&mdash;the
execution place of the Middle Ages. Next moment
the young radio-engineer, feeling himself gripped
suddenly and rushed to the edge of the precipice,
executed, to save his life, a very clever man&oelig;uvre, and
by dint of some swift athletic turns he succeeded in
swinging round his adversary until the latter had his
back to the precipice.</p>

<p>The two men fought for life, there upon the very
brink of the grave! Martin was determined to silence
his accuser.</p>

<p>But Geoffrey, who at Oxford had learnt the Japanese
system of self-defence, suddenly gripped the assassin
by the waist, and rushing him backwards to the cliff,
flung him from him with force, crying:</p>

<p>&#8220;That is your fate&mdash;the same that every secret
poisoner deserves!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a scream, and next instant the scoundrel
struck a pointed rock just below. Then he fell heavily
from crag to crag until, a few seconds later, he lay
deep down in the undergrowth at the cliff foot, mangled
and dead&mdash;his fate being indeed a just one.</p>

<p>Next day the <i>Imparçial</i>, in Madrid, printed a long
account of the tragic discovery, with a photograph
of the dead English servant. The paper called it &#8220;The
Mystery of the Crow&#8217;s Cliff.&#8221; But even to-day Mr.
Mapleton with the doctor and Mrs. Garcia naturally
regard the whole affair as a tragic mystery, for they
still aver that the butler Martin was one of the most
trustworthy of servants, and believe that he must
have met with foul play at the hands of some
low-born enemy. Mrs. Mapleton alone suspects the
truth!</p>

<p>Three months after the affair Geoffrey Falconer,
who had been paid a very considerable sum for the
rights of his improved microphone amplifier and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
several improvements in wireless calling devices, asked
Mrs. Beverley for her daughter&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Wild Widow&#8221; admired him, and after a long
discussion, gave her consent. So six months ago they
were married at St. Martin&#8217;s-in-the-Fields, and at the
wedding nearly half the engineering staff from the
Marconi Works at Chelmsford attended.</p>

<p>Truly the guilty secrets of many men and women
have been detected by means of wireless, that science
which daily reveals its further wonders to those persevering
experimenters who seek so patiently to
penetrate its mysteries.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
